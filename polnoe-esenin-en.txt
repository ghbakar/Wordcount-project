POET

		He is pale. Thinks a terrible way.
		Visions live in his soul.
		The blow of life hammered in the chest,
		And cheeks drank doubt.

		tufts of hair knocked down,
		A high forehead in wrinkles,
		But clear dreams of his beauty
		Lit in thoughtful pictures.

		He sits in a cramped attic,
		The stub of a candle cuts the eyes,
		And the pencil in his hand
		She has secret conversations with him.

		He writes a song of sad thoughts,
		He catches the shadow of the past with his heart.
		And this noise... soulful noise...
		He will take it down tomorrow for a ruble.

		1910-1912


NIGHT

		Tired day turned to night
		The noisy wave subsided
		The sun went out, and over the world
		The moon floats thoughtfully.
		The quiet valley listens
		The murmur of a peaceful stream.
		And the dark forest, leaning, dries
		To the sound of nightingale songs.
		Listening to songs, with the shores,
		Caressing, the river whispers.
		And quietly heard above her
		The cheerful rustle of the reeds.

		1911-1912


STARS

		The stars are clear, the stars are high!
		What do you keep in yourself, what do you hide?
		Stars, hiding deep thoughts,
		By what power do you captivate the soul?

		Frequent stars, tight stars!
		What is beautiful in you, what is powerful in you?
		What do you carry, heavenly stars,
		The power of the great burning knowledge?

		And why is it that when you shine
		Beckon to the sky, into wide arms?
		Look so tenderly, caress your heart,
		Heavenly stars, distant stars!

		1911


I. D. RUDINSKY

		sun ray golden
		threw his spark
		And with its warmth
		Warmed my soul.

		And hope in my chest
		Hiding mine;
		I'm waiting for something ahead
		From the days to come.

		Warmly revived,
		The light illuminated me.
		I forgot what's gone
		And what I don't have.

		The blood caught fire
		Hotter than day and fire.
		And light and warm
		In my heart.

		Feelings are full of good
		The heart is beating faster.
		The beam revived me
		warmth .

		I go with love
		On the indicated path
		And from pain and anxiety
		The chest is not worried.

		1911


MEMORY

		Outside the window, at the gate
		The blizzard is howling
		And on the stove the old man
		Youth remembers.

		"Oh, there was a time
		Lived, longing without knowing
		Only reveled and walked ,
		Singing songs.

		Now what is life?
		I'm languishing in anguish
		And sometimes about those days
		I remember with sadness.

		Walked for a century
		They say enough.
		Wave the old
		They don't give a break.

		Full, they say, old man,
		Don't fool around too much
		Your end is not great
		Your life is at the grave.

		Well, well, I'll submit -
		Apparently my share.
		The time will come for them too
		Elder grief."

		Outside the window, at the gate
		The blizzard is howling
		And on the stove the old man
		Falls asleep sadly.

		1911-1912


MY LIFE

		As if my life is doomed to suffering;
		Sorrow, together with longing, barred my way;
		As if with joy life is forever parted,
		From longing and from wounds, the chest was weary.

		As if in my life I had a lot of suffering;
		I had an unenviable share in my life.
		And so in my life I endured a lot of things,
		The soul languishes from anguish and from grief.

		Far foggy joy and happiness promises,
		And when I get there, only sighs and tears are heard.
		Suddenly a thunderstorm will come, a strong thunder will roar
		And destroy the magical, sweet dreams.

		I guessed and understood life's deception,
		I do not grumble at my unenviable lot.
		The soul does not suffer from longing and from wounds,
		No one will help either suffering or grief.

		1911-1912


WHAT PASSED - DO NOT RETURN

		Do not return to me that cool night,
		I can't see my girlfriend
		Do not hear me that song of joy,
		a nightingale sang in the garden!

		That spring night has gone,
		You won't tell her: "Come back, wait."
		Autumn weather has come
		It rains endlessly.

		A friend sleeps soundly in the grave,
		Bury love in your heart.
		The autumn blizzard won't wake you up
		Sound sleep, will not excite even the blood.

		And that song of the nightingale fell silent,
		Over the seas the nightingale flew away,
		Doesn't sound anymore, strong
		That he sang cool at night.

		Sweet joys have flown by,
		What I experienced in my life then.
		Feelings are already cold in my heart.
		What has passed will never be returned.

		1911-1912


NIGHT

		Quietly the river slumbers.
		The dark forest does not make noise.
		The nightingale does not sing
		And the jerk does not scream.

		Night. Silence around.
		The stream just gurgles.
		With its brilliance the moon
		Everything around is silver.

		Silver river.
		The stream is silver .
		silver grass
		Irrigated steppes.

		Night. Silence around.
		Everything in nature sleeps.
		With its brilliance the moon
		Everything around is silver.

		1911-1912


SUNRISE

		Red dawn lit up
		In the dark blue sky
		The band appeared clear
		In its golden brilliance .

		The rays of the sun are high
		Reflected light in the sky.
		And scattered far
		From them new in response.

		Rays of bright gold
		Light up the ground all of a sudden.
		The skies are already blue
		Spread around.

		1911-1912


TO THE DEAD

		The lid is tightly closed
		So that you can't get up forever
		Buried with cold earth
		Where only the unfeeling sleep.

		You will be silent at our loud call,
		When we get here.
		And at the same time with a familiar hand
		We will lay wreaths for you.

		Those wreaths will be beauty,
		The grave will be in them .
		Friends won't forget you
		And they will often be remembered.

		Rest in peace, our dear friend,
		And wait for us.
		We will endure grief with strength,
		Perhaps soon we will come to you.

		1911-1912


WINTER

		Autumn has flown away
		And winter came.
		As on wings, flew
		She is suddenly invisible.

		Here the frost crackled
		And they forged all the ponds.
		And the boys screamed
		Thanks to her for her hard work.

		Here come the patterns
		On glasses of wondrous beauty.
		Everyone fixed their eyes
		Looking at it. From high

		Snow g falls, flashes, winds,
		Lies down with a white veil.
		Here the sun flashes in the clouds,
		And the frost on the snow sparkles.

		1911-1912


THE SONG OF THE OLD ROBERT

		My youth is gone
		The beauty in the face withered,
		And there is no longer the former
		And there was no power.

		Been oh, knocked down five
		I'm off my feet with my club,
		Now frail and old I have become
		And crying fate.

		Used to sing songs
		From morning to dark night
		Now longing sucks me
		And sadness pierces my heart.

		Once upon a time I was daring
		Robbed and robbed
		Now I have become frail and old,
		He left everything before.

		1911-1912


SICK THOUGHTS


* * *

		I have no strength to sing or cry,
		There are bitter moments
		Ready to pour out all the feelings
		And the sounds themselves run.

		1911-1912


* * *

		Is it my fault that I am a poet
		Heavy torment and bitter share,
		Not by my own will I became -
		That's how he was born.

		Is it my fault that life is not nice to me,
		And that I love everyone and hate together,
		And I know about myself that I still don't see -
		After all, the muse brought me this gift.

		I know that there is no happiness in life,
		She is nonsense, the dream of the sick soul,
		And I know that my dull melody is boring to everyone,
		But it's not my fault - I'm such a poet.

		1911-1912


DUMES

		Sad thoughts, deep thoughts,
		Bitter thoughts, heavy thoughts,
		Thoughts forever far from happiness,
		Companions of my life are sad!

		Thoughts are the parents of the sounds of torment,
		Unhappy thoughts, cold thoughts,
		Thoughts are sources of tears of grief,
		Free thoughts, free thoughts!

		That you torment your weary chest,
		Why are you blocking my way to me? ..
		That you excite strength with a broken
		Again to fight against impenetrable darkness?

		Do not support you a burnt out fire,
		Extinguished sparks... Too late, fruitless.
		Do not heal the hearts of your sick,
		Thoughts sick, without life, cold!

		1911-1912


SOUNDS OF SAD

		Boring songs, sad sounds,
		Let me breathe freely.
		You bring me severe torment,
		It hurts your chest.

		Give me comfort, give me peace
		Let me sleep soundly.
		Thoughts after thoughts of a vague swarm,
		You broke my path.

		Be silent, sounds are messengers of grief,
		Tears are already pouring from the eyes.
		Let the bitter share calm down.
		Sounds! I'm sad for you!

		Sounds of sadness, mournful sounds
		How long will you torment me?
		Will the torment soon end?
		Will I live in peace soon?

		1911-1912


TEARS

		Tears ... again these bitter tears ,
		Desperate sadness and sadness;
		Darkness again... and broken dreams
		Rushed off into the endless distance.

		What's next? Again this torment?
		No, that's enough... It's time to rest
		And forget those sad sounds
		The chest was already so weary.

		Who sings there under the canopy of a birch ?
		Sounds like familiar to me -
		These are tears again... These are tears
		And longing for the native side.

		But I'm in my dear homeland,
		And in tears he weary his chest.
		Eh ... only, apparently, in a cold grave
		I can forget and fall asleep.

		1911-1912


* * *

		Not to be seen beyond the foggy distance,
		What will happen to me ahead
		What is there ... happiness, or sadness blows,
		Or rest for the poor chest.

		Or these gray mists
		Will make me sad again
		Inflict grievous wounds on the heart
		And again burn without fire.

		But through the dusk in the foggy distance&#769;
		Lights up, I see the dawn;
		This is death for the sad land
		This is death, but peace for me.

		1911-1912


A blizzard on April 26, 1912

		What do you need, blizzard?
		You howl at the window
		You worry about a sick heart,
		sadness and sadness .

		Go away quickly
		Let me forget a little
		Or do not you hear - I'm crying,
		Do I repent of my sins before God?

		Give me with fervent prayer
		Merge with soul and strength.
		All of me was spent in spirit,
		Soon I will hide in the grave.

		Sing you then over me
		Just gone now
		Or for a sinful soul
		Pray with me.

		1912


SCHOOL STAY

		I feel stuffy in these cold walls,
		Dampness and darkness without a light.
		Mold smells in sad corners -
		Here it is, the share of the poet.

		It can be seen that I am forever condemned to lach
		These fates are sentences
		Bitter tears resignedly pour,
		They torment their eyes.

		No, it's better then hurry up
		Let me go to the grave
		Only there I can, and only in it,
		Heal all broken forces.

		Only there I can rest
		Forget these heavy torments,
		Only there the chest does not worry
		And sad sounds are not heard.

		1911-1912


DISTANT MERRY SONG

		Far, far away from me
		Someone is singing a funny song.
		And I would like to repeat to her,
		Yes, a broken chest does not give.

		In vain the soul is torn to her,
		Looking for sounds like in the chest,
		Because all my strength
		Exhausted still ahead.

		Too soon I started to fly
		For the dream of the ideal of the earth,
		Early began to grumble for happiness,
		Understanding the lived distance.

		Early with his ardent soul
		I was looking for a dark day
		And now I can not echo her,
		Because I don't have the strength.

		1911-1912


MY DREAMS

		My dreams go far
		Where cries and sobs are heard,
		Share someone else's sadness
		And the pain of severe suffering.

		I can find myself there
		Joy in life, indulgence ,
		And there, against fate,
		I will look for inspiration.

		1911-1912


BROTHER MAN

		It's hard and sad for me to see
		How my brother dies.
		And I try to hate everyone
		Who is at enmity with his silence.

		Look how he works in the field
		Plows hard ground with a plow,
		And listen to those songs about grief
		What he sings, walking a furrow.

		Or do you not have tender pity
		To the sufferer of a plow with a harrow?
		You see the death you yourself inevitable,
		And you pass by him.

		Help me to fight the wickedness
		With poured wine, and with need!
		Or do not you hear, he is crying shares
		In your song, walking the furrow?

		1911-1912


VILLAGE HUT

		dilapidated hut
		Grief and worries
		The blizzard often cries
		At your gate

		Often distributed
		Behind your wall
		Complaints about poverty
		Songs sound muffled.

		Everyone sings about grief
		About heavy oppression
		About dashing need
		And a hungry year.

		No fun songs
		Within your walls
		Because grief
		Silences them.

		1911-1912


STEP AWAY FROM THE WINDOW

		Don't go under my window
		And do not trample the green grass;
		I fell out of love with you for a long time
		But do not cry, but calmly be silent.

		I pity you with all my heart
		What do you care about my beauty?
		Why don't you give me peace
		And why are you so tormented?

		Still I won't be yours
		I don't love anyone now
		I don't love you, but I pity you
		Get away from my window!

		Forget that I was yours
		That I loved you madly;
		Now I do not love, but I regret -
		Get away and don't torture yourself!

		1911-1912


SPRING EVENING

		Silently flowing silver river
		In the kingdom of evening green spring.
		The sun sets behind the wooded mountains,
		The golden horn emerges from the moon.

		The West turned into a pink ribbon,
		The plowman returned to the hut from the fields,
		And behind the road in the birch thicket
		The nightingale sang the song of love.

		Listens tenderly to deep songs
		From the west, a pink ribbon of dawn.
		With tenderness looks at the distant stars
		And the earth smiles at the sky.

		1911-1912


* * *

		And above me the star burns,
		But dimly glows in the fog,
		And I have a wide path
		But it is overgrown with weeds.

		And sends me all the light of a smile,
		But only full of contempt,
		And fate brings me greetings,
		But tears instead of consolation.

		1911-1912


POET

		Not a poet who is the words of a prophet
		Doesn't want to learn
		Who caustically vice
		Can't expose.

		Not a poet who is afraid himself
		To hurt the strong
		Who is proud of victory
		Can intimidate the weak.

		Not a poet and who has
		Different love for people
		Who for the truth does not know how
		Shed blood with enemies.

		That poet, who destroys enemies,
		Whose native truth is the mother,
		Who loves people like brothers
		And I'm ready to suffer for them.

		He will do everything freely
		That others couldn't.
		He is a poet, a folk poet,
		He is a poet of his native land!

		1912


DROPS

		Pearl drops, beautiful drops,
		How good are you in the rays of gold,
		And how sad you are, rainy drops,
		Black autumn on damp windows .

		People who are cheerful in the life of oblivion,
		How great are you in the eyes of others
		And how pitiful you are in the darkness of the fall,
		There is no consolation for you in the world of the living.

		Autumn drops, how much you point
		On the soul of sadness you feel heavy.
		Quietly slide on the glass and wander,
		Just like you're looking for something fun.

		Unfortunate people, killed by life,
		With pain in your soul, you live your life.
		Sweet past, you are not forgotten,
		Often you call him back.

		1912


* * *

		Sad... mental anguish
		The heart is torn and torn
		Time boring sounds
		They don't even let me breathe.
		Lie down, but a bitter thought
		It doesn't go crazy...
		Head spinning from the noise.
		How can I be ... and myself
		My soul is languishing.
		There is no consolation in anyone.
		You are barely breathing.
		Dark and wild all around.
		Share! Why are you given!
		There is nowhere to lay your head,
		Life is both bitter and poor,
		It is hard to live without happiness.

		1913


* * *

		And bitter tears fell to the ground,
		And it was hard and so sad for me,
		And yet we did not understand each other.
		You rushed off to distant lands,
		And all my dreams will fade without color,
		And again I was left alone
		Suffer soul without affection and greetings.
		And often in the evening I sometimes
		I go to places of cherished rendezvous,
		And I see in my dreams your sweet image,
		And I hear in the silence dreary sobs.

		1913


AT THE GRAVE

In memory of the deceased

		In this grave under humble willows
		He sleeps buried in the ground
		With a pure soul, with holy impulses,
		With the faith of the fiery dawn.

		Quietly extinguished the blessed fires
		In the heart of the sufferer of the earth,
		And on the forehead, no one understands,
		Dark shadows lay.

		sleeps , and the willows leaned over him,
		Hanging branches all around
		As if in thought they plunged,
		Think thoughts about him.

		Quietly from the wind, which let in anguish,
		Crying, frowning, far away.
		Like all of them without time bent
		Sorry for the poor young man.

		1912-1913

N. A. Sardanovsky

		Rapture is the poison of poison,
		Don't live among people
		Don't change your fun
		To the beauty of colorless days.

		Everything will pass, and life is cold
		A sensitive heart will squeeze,
		All that I lived when I was young
		Call it a stupid joke.

		Watch out for the breath of the rose
		Don't disturb her bushes.
		What is love? empty dreams,
		Delirium of a pipe dream.

		1914


YOUTH

		Dreams and tears
		Flowers and dreams
		I give you.

		From a quiet caress
		And gentle fairy tale
		I'm on fire.

		How much flour
		holy sounds
		They give me!

		But oh grated strength
		I'll send everything to hell.
		Come to me.

		1914


Confessions of a Suicide

		Farewell to me, my mother,
		I'm dying, I'm dying!
		Sick grief in the chest keeping,
		Don't cry for me.

		I could not live among people
		Cold poison in my soul.
		And what he lived and what he loved,
		I poisoned myself insanely.

		With my proud soul
		I passed by happiness.
		I saw the spilled blood
		And cursed faith and love.

		I drank my cup to the bottom,
		The soul is full of poison.
		And now I'm fading into silence
		But before death it is easier for me.

		I erased the seal of the earth from my forehead,
		I am higher than the quivering in the dust.
		And let the slaves of passions live -
		Passion is disgusting to my soul.

		Crazy world, nightmare
		And life is a funeral song.
		And so I ended my life,
		I sing the last hymn to myself.

		And you are sick with anxiety
		Do not cry in vain over me.

		1913-1915


* * *

		I laid to your bed
		semi withered flowers,
		And dead with petals
		My weary dreams

		I whispered to my lefties
		About fading love
		And you to mourned chambers
		Don't call me anymore.

		We do not live, but we yearn.
		For us, a moment of beauty
		But you won't ignite with a kiss
		My cold lips

		And let me read everything in my dreams:
		"You didn't love, you don't feel sorry"
		But I understand better
		Your love sadness

		1913-1915


ENCHANTMENTS

		In the colors of love, spring-princess
		She unraveled her braids through the grove,
		And with the choir of a bird prayer
		The bells sing the hymn to her.
		Drunk under the spell of fun
		She, like smoke, glides through the woods,
		And a golden necklace
		Shines in shaggy hair.
		And after her a drunken mermaid
		Dew splashes on the moon .
		And I, like a passionate violet,
		I want to love, love spring.

		1914


STORM

		The leaves trembled, the maples swayed,
		Dust flew from the golden branches ...
		The winds rustled, the green forest groaned,
		The dry feather grass whispered with an echo ...

		A cloudy storm is crying at the window ,
		The willows bent to the cloudy glass
		And the branches shake, bowing their heads,
		And with longing gloomy look in the semi-darkness ...

		And in the distance, blackening, clouds crawl out,
		And the river roars angrily,
		Water steeps raise splashes,
		Like a strong hand tosses the earth.

		19 14-1915


* * *

		You left and won't come back to me
		You forgot my corner
		And now you're laughing at someone else
		Covered in a white scarf.

		I'm sad, and bored, and sorry,
		Uncomfortably, my fireplace burns,
		But the violet crumpled in the book
		Everything about the happiness of the past speaks .

		1913-1915


* * *

		On a heavenly blue platter
		Yellow clouds of honey smoke.
		Dreaming of the night. People fell asleep.
		I'm just sad.

		Crossed by clouds
		Sweet smoke inhales boron.
		For the ring of heavenly cracks
		Slope pulls fingers.

		a heron croaking in the swamp ,
		Water splashes clearly
		And from the clouds looks like a drop,
		Lone star.

		I would like in cloudy smoke
		With that star, set fire to the forests
		And die with them
		Like lightning - to heaven.

		1913-1915




Poems of 1910



* * *

		It's evening. Dew
		Shines on nettles.
		I'm standing by the road
		Leaning against the willow.
		Big light from the moon
		Right on our roof.
		Somewhere the song of a nightingale
		In the distance I hear.
		Good and warm
		Like in the winter by the stove.
		And birches stand
		Like big candles.
		And far beyond the river
		Visible oh, behind the edge,
		Sleepy watchman knocks
		Dead beater.
		1910


* * *

		Where there are cabbage patches
		Sunrise pours red water,
		Maple tree small womb
		Green udder sucks.

		1910


* * *

		Winter sings - calls out,
		Shaggy forest cradles
		Stop the pine forest.
		Around with deep longing
		Sailing to a distant land
		Gray clouds.

		And in the yard a snowstorm
		Spreads like a silk carpet,
		But it's painfully cold.
		Sparrows are playful
		Like orphan children
		Huddled at the window.

		Little birds are chilled,
		Hungry, tired
		And they huddle tighter.
		A blizzard with a furious roar
		Knocks on the shutters hung
		And getting more and more angry.

		And gentle birds doze
		Under these whirlwinds of snow
		At the frozen window.
		And they dream of a beautiful
		In the smiles of the sun is clear
		Spring beauty.

		1910 _


SONG IMITATION

		You watered the horse from handfuls in a bridle,
		Reflecting, the birch trees broke in the pond.

		I looked out the window at the blue scarf,
		Her black curls were ruffled by the breeze.

		I wanted in the flickering foamy jets
		From your scarlet lips with pain to pluck a kiss.

		But with a sly smile, splashing on me,
		You galloped away, ringing with the bits.

		Time wove a thread in the yarn of sunny days.
		They carried you past the windows to be buried.

		And under the weeping memorial services, under the censer canon,
		All I fancied was a quiet, uninhibited ringing.

		1910


* * *

		Weaved out on the lake the scarlet light of dawn.
		Capercaillie are crying in the forest with bells.

		An oriole is crying somewhere, hiding in a hollow.
		Only I don't cry - my heart is light.

		I know that in the evening you will go beyond the ring of roads,
		Let's sit in fresh shocks under the neighboring one hundred city .

		I'll kiss you when I'm drunk, I'll crush you like a flower,
		There is no gossip to the intoxicated with joy.

		You yourself, under the caresses, will throw off the silk of the veil,
		I'll take the drunk until the morning into the bushes.

		And let the capercaillie cry with bells.
		There is a merry melancholy in the alost of the dawn.

		1910


* * *

		Smoke flood
		The silt has licked.
		yellow reins
		Lost the moon.

		I'm going on a barge
		I poke at the shore.
		By the churches by the spindles
		Red stacks.

		A mournful kark
		Into the silence of the marshes
		Black Capercaillie
		Calls for the all-night service.

		Grove in blue darkness
		Covers bareness...
		I will pray furtively
		For your destiny

		1910


* * *

		Bird cherry sprinkles with snow,
		Greenery in bloom and dew.
		In the field, leaning towards shoots,
		Rooks are walking in the band.

		The silk grasses will vanish,
		Smells like resinous pine.
		Oh you, meadows and oak forests, -
		I'm besotted with spring.

		Rejoicing secret news
		Glow in my soul.
		I think about the bride
		I only sing about her.

		Rash you, bird cherry, with snow,
		Sing, you birds, in the forest.
		Unsteady run across the field
		I will spread the color with foam.

		1910


KALIKI

		Kaliki passed by villages,
		We drank kvass under the windows,
		At the churches before the gates of the ancients
		Worshiped the most pure Savior.

		Wanderers made their way across the field,
		They sang a verse about the sweetest Jesus.
		Nags with luggage stomped past,
		Loud geese sang along.

		Wretched hobbled through the herd,
		Suffering speeches were spoken :
		"We all serve the Lord,
		Laying the chains on the shoulders.

		They took out the kaliki hastily
		Saved crumbs for cows.
		And the shepherds shouted mockingly:
		"Girls, dance! The buffoons are coming!"

		1910




Poems of 1911



* * *

		Under the wreath of forest chamomile
		I planed, repaired boats,
		Dropped the cutie's ring
		In a jet of foamy wave.

		a bitter separation,
		What a wicked mother-in-law.
		The pike took the ring,
		With him - sweet love.

		My ring was not found
		I went from longing to the meadow,
		M not after the river laughed:
		"The cutie has a new friend."

		I will not go to the round dance:
		They laugh at me
		I'll get married in bad weather
		With a ringing wave.

		Dark night, can't sleep
		I'll go out to the river to the meadow.
		Unbelted lightning
		In the foam with truyah belt.

		On a hillock a birch-candle
		In lunar feathers of silver.
		Come out my heart
		Listen to the songs of the harpist.

		I'm in love, I'll take a look
		For girlish beauty
		And I'll go dancing to the harp,
		So I'll rip your veil.

		In the dark chamber, in the green forest,
		On silk kupyry,
		I'll take you down the slopes
		Until poppy dawn.

		Tanyusha was good, there was no more beautiful in the village,
		Red ruffle on white sundress on the hem.
		Tanya goes to the ravine for wattle fences in the evening.
		A month in a cloudy fog leads with clouds and clouds.

		A guy came out, bowed his curly head:
		"Are you goodbye, my joy, I will marry another."
		Pale as a shroud, cold as dew.
		Her scythe developed like a soul-snake.

		"Oh you, blue-eyed guy, I'll say no offense,
		I came to tell you: I'm marrying another.
		Not morning bells, but a wedding call,
		The wedding rides on carts, horsemen hide their faces.

		Not the cuckoos were sad - Tanya's relatives are crying,
		There is a wound on Tanya's temple from a dashing brush.
		A scarlet halo of blood was baked on the forehead , -
		Tanyusha was good, there was no more beautiful in the village.

Poems of 1912



* * *

		The evening began to smoke, the cat is dozing on the beam,
		Someone prayed, "Lord Jesus."

		Dawns are blazing, fogs are spinning,
		There is a crimson curtain over the carved window.

		Vyutsya cobwebs with a golden tale.
		Somewhere a mouse is scratching in a closed cage...

		At the forest glade - in the ties, heaps of bread,
		Ate, like spears, rested against the sky.

		They filled the groves with smoke under the dew ...
		Silence and relics rest in the heart.

		1912


* * *

		Play, play ah, talyanochka, raspberry furs.
		Come out to meet the outskirts, beauty, the groom.

		The heart glows with cornflowers, turquoise burns in it.
		I play talyanochka about blue eyes.

		Do not dawn in the jets of the lake weaved your pattern,
		Your handkerchief, embroidered, chalked over the hillside.

		Play, play, talyanochka, raspberry furs.
		Let the beauty listen to the groom's jokes.

		1912


* * *

		Mother went to the Bathhouse through the forest,
		Barefoot, with podtyki, wandered through the dew.

		Herbs were pricked by the fortune-telling legs,
		Weeping birth aya in kupyry from pain.

		Unbeknownst to the liver, seizures seized,
		The nurse gasped, and here she gave birth.

		I was born with songs in a grass blanket.
		Spring dawns twisted me into a rainbow.

		I grew up to maturity, the grandson of the Kupala night,
		The witching turmoil predicts happiness for me .

		Only not according to conscience, happiness is at the ready,
		I choose the prowess of the eyes and eyebrows.

		Like a white snowflake, I melt in the blue
		Yes, I'm sweeping my trail to the fate-razluchnitsa.

SONG ABOUT YEVPATIY KOLOVRATE

		Behind Slybysh's Poems
		The clouds are circling.
		A feather grass was smoking behind
		Underhoof tanaga.

		Oh, do not zym husk-lure
		Clogged the regrinds, -
		The evil Tatars rose
		To the Zaraisk side.

		Ryazan did not wait, did not smell
		And that robber dopot,
		Under a Varangian veil
		the dark night .

		Not an owl's ear squinted,
		And not the wolf's mouth grinned, -
		That Batu from Churilkov Hill
		Showed the horde to the glow.

		How the star-swallows looked,
		They made a thought-frying pan:
		Something Rus' zaholynulas,
		Al does not hear the clang of abusive language?

		Twitter street stars of the month:
		"Oh, you yellow lamb!
		You do not crush the heavenly grass,
		Stop fighting clouds.

		Raise your coal eyes
		On the Ryazan side
		Yes, dig in cutomarine,
		What is moving, swaying there?

		As the moon looked here from a leash,
		And the chewing gum has worn out its teeth,
		choked with a choke
		And coughed up blood on the ground.

		Oh, the blood is flowing,
		Pasture pastures groan,
		The evils of the Tatars played out,
		They draw blood with poloniki.

		Ahead is the khan himself on the bulge,
		Smiling on a horse
		And chewing , slobbering his beard,
		A piece of dead mare.

		He says in a raspy voice:
		"Oh, bro titans,
		Isn't it time for us to feast
		Send horses to Muscovy?

		*

		From Olyshan to Shviva Zavodi
		They know songs about Evpatiy.
		They are sung from the white call nati
		To the sermjazhnik.

		Although many songs are composed,
		Yes, not a word is respected
		Do not count the praises of that prowess,
		Do not discredit bold valor.

		Evpatiy's curls curled,
		In three rows they fell on the shoulders.
		Behind the glen there is a cut knife
		He propped up his white knee .

		How he kept the forge-roof,
		He forged horses and roamed,
		Yes pawn eels
		Pulled out with two fingers.

		Lots of smolt
		In the bins it is blunted.
		Not one sleeve of young women,
		Wiping, perforated.

		Yes, not love, you see, remote
		These are the sobs of gray bugs,
		And sweetheart to him,
		What is the Ryazan side.

		*

		Oh, it's not owls that cry at midnight, -
		The women are whining for Kolomna,
		In clamps and pads
		They took the husbands of the Tatars.

		Sweaty drovers whistle,
		They push the polonyannikov,
		Along the pizhnu path-path
		They put milestones heads.

		The boyars converged
		The court was rowed, the disputes got along,
		How to confuse them with the power of the enemy,
		Keep them Rus' kondovoy.

		Equipped the runaway
		They were awarded with a bright letter:
		"You run, call the kid
		To judge the light of Evpaty.

		*

		Oh, not a kolob rolling in the field
		At the call of the sorceress from Shekhmin, -
		The rider galloped to Pilevo,
		Yes, it turns back again.

		Shines on the fields of Ryazan
		Birch forest at the brilliance of the moon,
		Lighting up the path
		From Olyshan to Shviva Zavodi.

		The rider galloped to Evpatiy,
		He took out an elm letter:
		"Oh, you, azure bator,
		Rescue Rus' from dashing!

		*

		At Palaga-shinkacherikha
		Wine is diluted on honey,
		Red couches
		Curtained with showerheads.

		Comrades came together
		The light of the good Evpaty,
		They thought over the fuselage of thoughts,
		They washed down thoughts with braga.

		Evpatiy said to the hawkers:
		"Oh, other bosoms,
		Don't drink green wine
		Do not ruin the Russian estimate.

		Green wine - destruction of thoughts,
		It is to Telesam like a scythe to grass,
		Evil enemies will attack you
		And they will scatter you to straws!

		*

		Not the dawn flows beyond Kolomna,
		Not a fire stands over Putin -
		Falcons fight,
		Flying into the Tatars.

		Baty's heart stirred:
		What happened there, happened?
		Didn't the people of Ryazan get up dead
		On a bloody battle?

		And to become Ryazans -
		Only drunk sleep;
		Wouldn't be in a fight
		And lie in sheaves.

		The khan rides on the white batyr,
		The saliva drips from the lips.
		And Yevpaty did not pull out a sword,
		The candle lit up in her hands.

		Not white birches
		Hemmed from under the gonobi -
		Friends falcons died
		Under the Tatar notches.

		The fierce khanishche will exclaim:
		"Oh, hell, you bastards.
		Comfort the batyr's skull
		What about a fusel bowl.

		He doesn't drink anymore, he's curvy
		Look around and sniff -
		"And all you, Russian power,
		Good for the tynovye."

		1912




Poems of 1913



BIRCH

		White birch
		under my window
		covered with snow,
		Exactly silver.

		On fluffy branches
		snow border
		Brushes blossomed
		White fringe.

		And there is a birch
		In sleepy silence
		And the snowflakes are burning
		In golden fire

		A dawn, lazy
		Walking around,
		Sprinkles branches
		New silver.

		1913




Poems of 1914



POWDER

		I'm going. Quiet. Ringing is heard
		Under the hoof in the snow
		Only gray crows
		Made a noise in the meadow.

		Bewitched by the invisible
		The forest slumbers under the fairy tale of sleep,
		Like a white scarf
		The pine has tied up.

		Bent over like an old lady
		Leaned on a stick
		And above the crown
		The woodpecker hammers at the bitch.

		A horse is galloping, there is a lot of space,
		Snow falls and spreads a shawl.
		Endless road
		Runs off into the distance.

		1914


VILLAGE

		(From Taras Shevchenko)

		Village! Peace in my soul.
		Village in Ukraine dear,
		And full of fairy tales and wonders,
		Around the village is a green forest.
		Gardens bloom, huts turn white,
		And there are chambers on the mountain,
		And in front of a painted window
		In silk poplar leaves,
		And there is all the forest, and all the fields,
		And the steppe, and the mountains beyond the Dnieper ...
		And in the dark blue sky
		God himself hovers over the village.

		1914


* * *

		Dozing bell
		Woke up the fields
		Smiled with the sun
		Sleepy land.

		Blows rushed
		To blue skies
		loudly heard
		Voice through the woods.

		Hid behind the river
		White moon,
		ran loudly
		Rough wave.

		Silent Valley
		Drives away sleep
		Somewhere across the road
		The call fades.

		1914


BLACKSMITH

		Dushno in the gloomy forge,
		And the unbearable heat is heavy,
		And from the squeal and from the noise
		The head is in a frenzy.
		Leaning towards the anvil
		The blacksmith's hands are waving,
		Scattering like a red network,
		Sparks curl in the face.
		The gaze is brave and stern
		Shines with a rainbow of lights
		Like the swing of an eagle, ready
		Take off for the distance of the seas ...
		Forge, blacksmith, strike with a blow,
		Let sweat drip from your face.
		Set fire to hearts
		Away from grief and adversity!
		Cast off your impulses
		Turn impulses into steel
		And fly with a playful dream
		You are in the distance.
		away , behind the black cloud,
		Beyond the dark days
		The mighty brilliance of the sun flies
		Over the plains of the fields.
		Drowning pastures and fields
		In the blue light of the day
		And over the arable land happily
		Greens are ripening.
		Fly up to the sun with renewed vigor
		Ignite in its rays.
		Away from hateful shyness,
		Get rid of shameful fear.
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		1914


GOOD MORNING!

		Golden stars dozed off,
		The mirror of the backwater trembled,
		Light shines on the river backwaters
		And blushes the grid of the sky.

		Sleepy birch trees smiled,
		Tousled silk braids.
		Rustling green earrings,
		And silver dews are burning.

		The wattle fence has an overgrown nettle
		Dressed in bright mother-of-pearl
		And, swaying, he whispers playfully:
		"Good morning!"
		1914


PRAYER OF THE MOTHER

		On the edge of the village there is an old hut,
		There, an old woman is praying in front of the icon.

		The prayer of the old woman remembers her son,
		The son saves his homeland in a distant land.

		The old woman prays, wipes her tears,
		And in the eyes of the tired, dreams bloom.

		She sees the field, the field before the battle,
		Where lies the beaten son of her hero.

		Blood splatters on the wide chest like a flame,
		And in the hands of the frozen enemy banner.

		And from happiness with grief, she froze all over,
		She bowed her gray head in her hands.

		And the rare gray hairs closed the eyebrows,
		And from the eyes, like beads, tears are pouring .

		1914


BOGATYRSKY POSVIST

		Thunder boomed. The cup of heaven is broken.
		The dark clouds broke.
		On light gold pendants
		Heavenly lamps swayed.
		The angels opened the high window,
		They see - a headless cloud dies,
		And from the west, like a wide ribbon ,
		A bloody dawn rises.
		The servants of God guessed
		It's not for nothing that the earth is waking up,
		It can be seen, they say, the Germans are worthless
		The war rises against the peasant.
		The angels said to the sun:
		"Wake up the man, red,
		Bang him on the head
		Say, trouble is dangerous for you.
		A man got up, washes from a ladle,
		Gently talks with poultry,
		Having washed, he dresses up in bast shoes
		And he takes out openers with a club.
		The man is thinking dear to the forge:
		"I'll teach you a filthy mug."
		And on the go with anger pushing,
		He throws off his torn sermyaga from his shoulders.
		The blacksmith made a sharp peak for the peasant,
		And the man sat down on a kicking nag.
		He rides the motley road,
		Whistling a mighty song
		The man chooses a more noticeable path,
		Rides, whistles, grins,
		The Germans see - the oaks trembled for a century,
		On the oaks from the whistle, the leaves fall down.
		The Germans threw down their copper hats,
		They were frightened by the whistling of the heroic ...
		Rus' rules victorious holidays,
		The earth is buzzing from the ringing of the monastery.

ORPHAN

		(Russian fairy tale)

		Masha is an orphan.
		It's bad, it's bad for Masha to live,
		Evil stepmother angrily
		He scolds her without guilt.

		unborn sister
		Masha does not give a place,
		Masha is crying quietly
		And furtively sheds tears.

		Masha will not reread the abuse,
		Does not lose bold words
		And the wicked sister
		Repels suitors.

		Masha's evil stepmother
		Took her outfit
		Masha walks without clothes,
		And the guys don't look.

		Masha walks in a sundress,
		The sundress is all of the patches,
		And on the stepmother's daughter
		Beads with earrings rattle.

		Masha sewed for handouts
		Sundress is different
		And put on my head
		Half alok blue.

		Masha wants to dress up
		Go to the Church of God
		And the stepmother's angry
		She asks to buy beads for her.

		Evil stepmother on Masha
		Rolled up my sleeves
		On the lips of poor Masha
		And so the words froze.

		Masha came out, sobbed,
		There's just nowhere to go
		run to the cemetery,
		No graves to be found.

		The gray blizzard swept
		A field of snow,
		Potholes along the paths
		And snowdrifts under the window.

		Masha came out on the porch,
		It hurt her unbearable.
		And the other only howls the wind,
		And around only only night.

		is crying at the porch,
		Lurking around the corner
		And tearful eyes
		Wipes with sleeve.

		Masha is crying, the cold is getting stronger.
		Angry Santa Claus
		And from her eyes, like pearls,
		Drops of tears flow.

		A month has passed because of the clouds,
		Played with bright light.
		Masha sees - on the step
		Someone scattered the beads.

		From unexpected happiness
		Masha raised her eyes
		And with frozen hands
		Collected large pearls.

		Only Masha for the ring
		Opens the door with his hand
		And from a high snowdrift
		An old gray-haired man runs towards her:

		"Hey, beauty, stop ,
		Quite a blizzard!
		Somewhere here on the porch
		I forgot pearls.

		Masha with secret anxiety
		Shyly raised her eyes
		And she stammered:
		"I put them in an apron."

		And from the apron bashfully,
		Covering your face with your hands,
		Masha poured out pearls
		On the frozen porch.

		"Stop, child, don't rash, don't, -
		The gray-haired old man says,
		This is beads for beads,
		These are pearls, Masha, yours.

		Masha laughs with joy
		Blushed, worth it
		And the old man, bending over her,
		So gently says to her:

		"Oh child, I saw, I saw,
		How many tears have you shed
		And like a dashing stepmother
		She drove you out of the hut.

		And in the hut your sister
		I admired myself
		And, combing the braids,
		Laughed at you.

		You sobbed at the porch,
		And around the chalk blizzard,
		I am a reward for your tears
		Frozen in pearls.

		For you, my dear
		It hurt me unbearable
		And embittered breath
		I caught a cold mother and daughter.

		That's all my reward
		For your streams of tears...
		After all, Masha, I am very kind,
		I'm Santa Claus."

		And the crackling frost disappeared ...
		Masha collected pearls
		And, listening to the blizzard,
		She stood and left.

		Early in the morning Masha
		Went to dig a grave
		At this time the courtiers
		Went looking for a beauty.

		The king ordered them strictly
		Get around your country
		And beauty by yourself
		Find yourself a wife.

		See, they gave Masha,
		Masha began to say
		Only Masha decided
		Bury the dead first.

		Quietly celebrated the wake,
		The pain subsided in my heart,
		And on Masha, on the orphan,
		The king himself got married.

WHAT IT IS?

		Enchanted into this forest,
		By fluff from a rib,
		Me with a loaded rifle
		I went hunting yesterday.
		The path is clean and smooth
		I passed, did not inherit ...
		Who was sneaking around here?
		Who fell and walked here?
		I'll come and take a closer look:
		The fragile snow is all broken.
		Here are the claws, then skis ...
		Someone strange was running around here.
		If only I knew the secret
		enchanted words,
		I would know by chance
		Who walks around here at night.
		Because of the tree would be high
		I spied on the circle:
		Who is a deep trace distant
		Leaves in the snow?

		1914


PATTERNS

		The girl in the room embroiders fabrics,
		On the canvas in patterns of spears and crosses.
		The girl draws the dead in the clearing,
		On the chest of the dead are red flowers.

		Delicate silk brings forth a brave hero,
		That brave hero is the prince of her soul.
		He lies, slain in the hot fight of battle,
		And in the patterns of blood the reeds are crumpled.

		Finished drawings. The lamp burns out.
		The girl bent over. The gaze blurred.
		The girl is sad. The girl is crying.
		Behind the window, midnight draws its pattern.

		The mourning scythes of the clouds swept away,
		in the strands of thin curls .
		In a quivering shimmer, in a white veil
		The girl, like a ghost, is crying at the window.

		1914


BELGIUM

		Defeated but not a slave
		You stand proudly without armor,
		Your shrine is desecrated
		But the soul is pure as snow.
		Bloody feast in the smoke of the fire
		Arranged formidable Satan,
		And under the sword of his blow
		The brave country is broken.
		But the spirit is free, the spirit is mighty
		Great forces did not extinguish,
		He, like an eagle, soars behind a cloud
		Above the chain of valiant graves.
		And the lot of truth will be completed:
		Your enemy will fall at your feet
		And will pray with sorrow
		To your broken altars

		1914


COACHER

		For the potholes of the steppe
		I rush with a ribbon of wastelands.
		Hey you, dear falcons,
		Take out quickly!

		undersized settlement
		In the evening smoke.
		Beauty was waiting for me
		In an enchanted theme .

		Shines in the darkness with gilding
		Painted arc.
		Oh you sled planes
		Fluffy snow!

		Cutting chimes, booming chimes,
		Bells in the collar do not count.
		And how I bark on the alley,
		All the people run out.

		Guys come out, girls come out
		Praise the winter evening ,
		Voiced choruses
		They don't stop until the morning.

		1914

		The reeds rustled over the backwater.
		The girl-princess is crying by the river.

		The red maiden told fortunes in seven.
		A wave unraveled a wreath of dodder.

		Ah, do not marry a girl in the spring,
		He frightened her with signs of the forest.

		The bark is eaten on the birch, -
		The mouse survives the girl from the yard.

		Horses are beating, menacingly waving their heads, -
		Oh, he doesn't like black braids brownie.

		The smell of incense from the spruce grove is poured,
		Calls winds sing dirge.

		A girl walks along the bank sad ,
		A gentle foamy wave weaves a shroud for her.

		Trinity morning, morning canon,
		In the grove along the birch trees there is a white chime.

		The village stretches from a festive dream,
		In the blessing of the wind, a drunken spring.

		There are ribbons and bushes on the carved windows.
		I'll go to Mass and lap up the flowers.

		Sing in the thicket, birds, I'll sing to you,
		Let's bury my youth together.

		Trinity morning, morning canon.
		In the grove along the birch trees there is a white chime.

		Beloved edge! Dreaming of the heart
		Stacks of the sun in the waters of the womb.
		I would like to get lost
		In the greens of your bells.

		Along the border, at the crossroads,
		Reseda and riza porridge.
		And call the rosary
		Willows are meek nuns.

		The swamp smokes with a cloud,
		Burn in the heavenly yoke.
		With a quiet secret for someone
		I kept my thoughts in my heart.

		I meet everything , I accept everything,
		Glad and happy to take out the soul.
		I came to this earth
		To leave her soon.

		I will go to skufia as a humble monk
		Ile blond tramp -
		Where it pours over the plains
		Birch milk.

		I want to measure the ends of the earth ,
		Trusting a ghost star
		And believe in the happiness of your neighbor
		In a furrow ringing with rye.

		Dawn hand cool dew
		Knocks down the apples of the dawn
		Raking hay in the fields
		The mowers sing songs to me.

		Looking beyond the rings of bast strands,
		I speak to myself :
		Happy is he who has adorned his life
		Wandering stick and bag.

		Happy is he who is wretched in joy,
		Living without friend and foe
		Pass along the country road
		Praying for shocks and haystacks.

		The Lord went to torture people in love,
		He went out poor to them in a bag.
		Old grandfather on a dry stump, in an oak tree,
		Zhamkal gums stale donut.

		The grandfather saw the beggar dear,
		On the path, with an iron club,
		And I thought: "Look, how miserable, -
		To know, it sways from hunger, sickly.

		The Lord approached, hiding sorrow and torment:
		It can be seen, they say, you can't wake their hearts ...
		And the old man said, holding out his hand:
		"Here, chew ... you will be a little stronger."

		The winds do not shower the forests,
		Falling leaves do not make the hills golden.
		From the blueness of the invisible bush
		Star psalms are streaming.

		I see - in a blueberry board,
		On light-winged clouds,
		Beloved mother is coming
		With a pure son in her arms.

		She bears for the world again
		Crucify the Risen Christ:
		"Go, my son, live, bring shelter,
		Dawn and spend half a day at the bush.

		And in every wanderer wretched
		I will go to find out with longing,
		Is it not anointed by God
		It knocks with a birch stick.

		And maybe I'll pass
		And I will not notice in the secret hour,
		That in the firs are the wings of a cherub,
		And under the stump - the hungry Spas.

IN THE HUT

		It smells of loose drachens ;
		At the threshold in a bowl of kvass,
		Over turned stoves
		Cockroaches climb into the groove.

		Soot curls over the damper,
		In the oven, the threads of popelits,
		And on the bench behind the salt shaker -
		Husks of raw eggs.

		Mother with grips will not cope,
		bending low,
		An old cat sneaks up on a mahotka
		For fresh milk.

		Restless chickens chuckle
		Over the shafts of the plow,
		In the yard I will have a slender dinner
		The roosters are singing.

		And in the window on the canopy are sloped,
		From the fearful noise
		From the corners puppies are curly
		They crawl into collars.

		In the village of the paths of an Inka Krivenka
		On a summer evening blue
		Recruits went with a shower
		Rough-necked bunch.

		Singing about loved ones
		Yes, the last few days
		"Farewell, dear village,
		Dark grove and stumps.

		The dawns foamed and melted.
		Everyone was shouting, puffing out their chests:
		"Before the rivers of rutstvo, grief mayed,
		And now it's time to roam."

		Waving fair-haired curls,
		They started dancing merrily.
		The girls rattled them with beads,
		They called for the village.

		The brave guys came out
		For humic wattle,
		And the girls are stupid
		Run away - catch up!

		Above the green hills
		Scarves fluttered.
		Through the fields, wandering with purses,
		The old people smiled.

		Through the bushes, in the grass above the basts,
		Under the fearful exclamation of owls,
		The grove laughed at them with tongues
		With overflowing voices.

		Through the village along a crooked path,
		Cheered on the stumps,
		Recruit played in the shower
		About the rest of the days.

* * *

		Goy you, Rus', my dear,
		Huts - in the robes of the image ...
		See no end and end -
		Only blue sucks eyes.

		Like a wandering pilgrim,
		I watch your fields.
		And at the low outskirts
		Ringing poplar chickpeas.

		Smells like apple and honey
		In the churches, your meek Savior.
		And buzzes behind the bark
		There is a cheerful dance in the meadows.

		I'll run along the wrinkled stitch
		To the freedom of the green lekh,
		Meet me like earrings
		A girlish laugh will ring out.

		If the holy army shouts:
		"Throw you Rus', live in paradise!"
		I will say: "Not a child of paradise,
		Give me my country."

		I am a shepherd, my chambers are
		Between undulating fields,
		On the green mountains - slopes
		With a hark of echoing great snipes.

		Knitting lace over the forest
		Clouds in yellow foam.
		In a quiet dreme under a canopy
		I hear the whisper of the pine forest.

		Shine green in the sky
		Under the dew of the poplar.
		I am a shepherd; my mansions -
		In soft green fields.

		cows talk to me
		In cursive language.
		Spirited oak trees
		They call branches to the river.

		Forgetting human grief
		I sleep on clearings of branches.
		I pray for scarlet dawns,
		I take communion by the stream.

		1914


* * *

		Is it my side, side,
		Hot stripe.
		Only the forest, yes salting,
		Yes, the river scythe ...

		The old church languishes
		Throwing a cross into the clouds.
		And sick cuckoo
		Does not fly from sad places.

		For you, my side,
		In the flood every year
		With a pillow and knapsacks
		Praying sweat pours.

		Faces are dusty, tanned,
		The eyelid gnawed out the distance,
		And dug into a thin body
		Save the meek sadness.

		Soh no melted clay,
		Mushrooms rot on the slopes.
		The wind blows across the plains,
		Red affectionate colt.

		It smells of willow and resin.
		Xin then dozes, then sighs.
		At the forest lectern
		Sparrow reads the psalter.

		Last year's leaf in the ravine
		Among the bushes - like a heap of copper.
		Someone in a sunny coat
		He rides on a red donkey.

		A strand of hair is more tender than a tow,
		But his face is hazy.
		Pines droop, spruces droop
		And they shout to him: "Hosanna!"

* * *

		I feel the Rainbow of God -
		I don't live in vain
		I worship the roadside
		I land on the grass.

		Between the pines, between the trees,
		Between birch curly beads,
		Under the wreath, in the ring of needles,
		I feel like Jesus.

		He calls me to the oak trees,
		As in the kingdom of heaven
		And burns in purple brocade
		Cloud covered forest.

		Pigeon spirit from God ,
		Like a fiery tongue
		Took my way
		He drowned out my weak cry.

		The flame pours into the abyss of sight,
		In the heart of the joy of children's dreams,
		I believed from birth
		In the protection of the Virgin.

		Prayers are walking along the road,
		Under the feet of the lyn and buttocks.
		Pushing apart the pinch pins,
		Crutches jingle in the ditches.

		Bast shoes are trampled across the puppetry field,
		Somewhere the neighing and snoring of the herd,
		And calls them from the big bell tower
		A booming sound, like the tongue of cast iron.

		The old women are shaking off,
		The girls knit braids to toe.
		From the courtyard from a high cell
		The monks look at their scarves.

		There are monastic signs on the gates:
		"I will give rest to those who come to me"
		And the dogs scattered in the garden,
		Like smelling thieves on the threshing floor.

		Twilight licks the gold of the sun,
		In the distant groves ringing rings out ...
		By the shade of the willow-spindle
		The Praying Mantis go to the canon.

* * *

		You are my abandoned land,
		You are my land, wasteland,
		hay uncut,
		Forest and monastery.

		The huts are concerned
		And all five.
		Their roofs are foaming
		Into the glowing path.

		Under with a crowbar
		Rafter rafters,
		Wind mold blue
		Sprinkled with the sun.

		They hit the windows without a miss
		crows wing,
		Like a blizzard, bird cherry
		Waving his sleeve.

		Didn't I say in the twig
		Your life and reality
		What in the evening traveler
		Whispered feather grass?

* * *

		The drought drowned out the sowing,
		The rye dries, and the oats do not sprout.
		At a prayer service with banners girls
		Stripes dragged in butts.

		The parishioners gathered at the bowl,
		Frantic sadness hidden.
		The icy deacon chirped:
		"Save, Lord, your people."

		Oh heaven's doors opened,
		The deacon barked out of his thick-set forces:
		"We still pray, brothers, for faith,
		So that God irrigates the fields for us.

		merry birds were pouring,
		Splattered pop from handfuls,
		Chirping magpies, like matchmakers,
		Rainy guests called.

		dawns foamed behind the grove,
		Like canvases the clouds crawled,
		And it's foggy in the skinny past
		The river cooed between the bushes.

		Throwing off their hats, praying and sighing,
		The men were talking:
		"The ear was not bad,
		Yes ruined the dry days.

		On a horse - a black cloud in a sled -
		The flame-helmet was beating ... blue and trembling.
		And the boys in the elanki shouted:
		"Rain, rain, fields our rye!"

* * *

		Black, then reeking howl!
		How can I not caress you, not love you?

		I will go out to the lake into the blue path,
		to the heart of the supper .

		Huts stand in a gray rope,
		The reeds squelch dully.

		The red fire bloodied the tagans,
		In the brushwood are the white eyelids of the moon.

		Quietly, squatting, in the patches of dawn
		They listen to the tale of the old mower.

		Somewhere in the distance, on the kukan of the river,
		A dreamy song is sung by the fishermen.

		The puddle shines like tin...
		Sad song, you are Russian pain.

		1914


* * *

		Swamps and swamps
		Blue boards of heaven.
		Coniferous gilding
		The forest is ringing.

		Tit tit
		Between forest curls,
		Dark firs dream
		The hubbub is braided.

		Through the meadow with a creak
		The convoy is stretching -
		Dryish linden
		Smells like wheels.

		Willows are listening
		Wind whistle...
		You are my forgotten edge,
		You are my native land! ..

EGORY

		In the blue expanses of the plateaus,
		In ribbons of clouds
		Collected by St. Egoriy
		White wolves.

		"Oh, lights, warriors,
		Hear my tale.
		I have a dashing outcast already
		There is a bow to you.

		All wolves build nests
		In the Murom forests.
		Stars in their eyes
		Childish fear.

		And from those gray-fronted
		Your mighty kind ,
		Like you, burns in malice
		Storm stronghold.

		But recently reconciled
		With a Russian man.
		They were angry for a long time, they fought for a long time
		You are secretly in the forest.

		There from the sunset skies
		The enemy jumps - strong,
		How about these woodlands
		Hold up full.

		I feel, goof manida will come out -
		You don't get along
		But the black planid
		Waving over the mountains."

		Wolves raised thunder:
		"We are panties!
		The claws are sharp, the teeth are sharp -
		Let's tear it to shreds!"

		Everyone gathered around
		Clean up your court.
		Terrible cry, distant rumble
		Their buzz froze.

		How they sensed the raid,
		We went out to the hillock.
		"You lead us to reprisal,
		Our brave Yegor!

		"Okay," Yegoriy told them, "
		I will lead you
		Between distant plateaus
		I'll cover the trouble."

		A rider with a long lance gallops,
		Scared all the owls.
		And the earth trembles from a cry
		Wolf voices.

MARFA POSADNYTSA

		1

		Not the sister of the month from the dark swamp
		She threw the kokoshnik into the sky in pearls, -
		Oh, how Martha went out the gate,
		She took out the black letter from the duleyka.

		The bell at the veche broke with its tongues,
		The dawn cloths waved with lace;
		The angels heard the voice of a man,
		Hastily they opened the sky-shutter windows.

		Martha will speak with a silvery voice:
		"Oh, Vaskin's grandchildren, Mikula's great-grandchildren!
		Moscow's charter voluntarily commanded
		To exorcise the freemen spree sprees!

		A riot came in, pulled out an old one,
		Beards, like lightning, stuck out menacingly:
		"What is Muscovy to us - like a pancake supplier!
		There, the boyars, those wives whip zagozno!

		Martha threw her right leg on the porch,
		With her left hand she waved a morocco heel .
		"To be so," she said meekly, she moved her black eyebrows,
		Not streams - sprinklers for dewy blooms ... "

		2

		Not a black talks with the Lord in seclusion
		The Tsar of Moscow Antichrist summons:
		"Oh, Vielzebubule, my woe, woe,
		Novgorod does not kiss my free legs !

		Satan came out of the oven like a viper,
		In bug-eyed walleyes, the devil of hell.
		"Swear to give me a soul as a guarantee,
		Otherwise, there will be no peace with Novgorod!"

		He took out papers - tufts of clouds,
		I gave him a pen - an arrow from lightning.
		The king struck his elbow with a dagger,
		He crossed out and pressed his hand to the floor.

		The Antichrist will roar with an earthly buzz:
		"And I give you four hundred years, O king!
		How will overseas Judas go to Moscow,
		Here you and Novgorod are out of trouble!

		"And where does the thunderstorm come from when the wind is noisy?" -
		asks him a cunning request.
		Satan speaks with the tongue of the black ones:
		"This answer was carried away by the wind..."

		3

		At the cathedrals of the Kremlin, the bells wept,
		Archers gathered from distant settlements;
		Horses neighed, sabers clanged,
		The voice of the clerk sedately heard the people.

		blushed , the images sparkled,
		The king granted a barrel of wine.
		The women wiped away their tears with their skirts, -
		Someone returns unharmed to the house?

		Archers went, dusted across the field:
		"Beware now, proud Novograd!"
		Peaks tinkled, horses stomped, -
		No one took pity and turned back.

		The king will say to his wife:
		"And there will be a feast on the red Braga!
		I sent to woo impolite families,
		I'll plant pillows of heads for everyone in the ravine. "

		"You are my lord," the wife shuffles,
		May my mind judge the judgment of you! ..
		You have been given power , you have been given a will,
		You only beat one fate with your forehead ... "

		4

		In the sleeve Martha prayed to God,
		She wiped her tears with her sleeve;
		She leaned over the window
		She called pigeons to her knees.

		"Already you, pigeons, servants of God,
		Solet-ko in the heavenly chamber ,
		Return to the earthly lair,
		Knock on the Novograd doors!"

		Doves brought a letter from God,
		Chopped with golden letters;
		Martha sat behind an embroidered braid:
		"You, my ruined happiness!"

		And the Lord wrote to his faithful servant:
		"Do not drive a swirling cloud with a broom;
		Like a Moscow tsar on a bloody spree
		I sold my soul to the Antichrist...

		5

		And now four hundred years have passed.
		Isn't it time for us guys to take up the mind,
		Fulfill St. Marfin's covenant:
		Drown out the noise of Moscow?

		And let's go, fighters, to catch gyrfalcons,
		We will send the wild-washer with the demand to the king:
		So that the king gives us an answer in that battle,
		So that he does not cover the Novograd dawn.

		You make noise, melodious Volokhov, make noise,
		Wake up Sadko and Busla for a huckster!
		Higher, higher, whirlwind, clouds rise!
		Oh, Novgorod, our dear!

		As in the past, the path ran;
		And let's go call capital Kyiv!
		Oh, are you bells from the Kremlin,
		And I suppose it's time for you to know!

		We will sing troparion to God with the winds,
		Let's make a white donut
		Will buzz to us from evening to the ring, as of old,
		Here I am, guys, and I'm done.

		September 1914


RUS

		1

		The village drowned in potholes,
		Blocked the huts of the forest.
		Only visible, on the bumps and hollows,
		How blue are the skies.

		Howling in the long, winter twilight,
		Wolves are formidable from the skinny fields.
		Through the yards in the burning hoarfrost
		The snoring of horses over the pimples.

		Like owl eyes, behind the branches
		They look at the blizzard's shawls for the lights.
		And stand behind the oak nets,
		Like evil spirits of the forest, hemp.

		The unclean power frightened us,
		Whatever the ice-hole - carried de sorcerers.
		In the evil frost in the misty twilight
		Galloons hang on birch trees.

		2

		But I love you, meek homeland!
		And for what - I can not figure it out.
		Your short joy is merry
		With a loud song in the spring in the meadow.

		I love over the mowing parking
		Listen to mosquitoes in the evening.
		And how the guys bark with talyanka,
		The girls will come out to dance around the fires.

		They will light up like black currants,
		Coal-eyes in the horseshoes of the eyebrows.
		Oh you, my Rus', dear homeland,
		Sweet rest in the silk of kupyrs.

		3

		Black crows croaked:
		Terrible troubles a wide scope.
		The whirlwind of the forest twists in all directions,
		Waves shroud foam from the lakes.

		Thunder struck, the cup of the sky was split,
		Ragged clouds enshroud the forest.
		On light gold pendants
		The lamps of heaven swayed.

		Cell phones were placed under the windows
		Militias go to war.
		Sloboda women zagygykali,
		A cry cut through the silence.

		Peaceful plowmen gathered
		Without sadness, without complaints and tears,
		They put sugar donuts in their bags
		And shoved on a dumpy cart.

		Through the village to the high outskirts
		saw them off indiscriminately ...
		That's where, Rus', your good fellows,
		All support in a time of adversity.

		4

		The village was exhausted by a bride -
		Somehow cute in a distant land?
		Why not notify the news -
		Were they killed in a hot battle?

		The grove smelled of incense,
		Bone clattering in the wind.
		And they came to them unexpectedly
		From the far volost piles of news.

		Plowmen saved a memo on them,
		Since then, everyone was taken out by letter.
		Relatives picked up a letter here,
		They sat down on the braid.

		Gathered over Chetnitsa Lusha
		Try your favorite speeches.
		And squatted crying, listening,
		On the success of native strongmen.

		5

		Ah, my fields, dear furrows,
		You are good in your sorrow!
		I love these sickly huts
		Waiting for gray-haired mothers.

		I will fall to the birch bark bast shoes,
		Peace be with you, rake, scythe and plow!
		I guess by the eyes of the bride
		In the war about the fate of the groom.

		I made peace with weak thoughts,
		If only I could become a bush by the water.
		I want to believe in the best with women,
		Warm the candle of the evening star.

		I figured out their countless thoughts ,
		Neither thunder nor darkness will frighten them away.
		Behind the plow to the cherished songs
		Death and prison will not be imagined.

		They believed in these scribbles
		Taken out with hard work,
		And wept with happiness and joy,
		As in a drought over the first rain.

		And behind the thought of separation from their families
		In soft grasses, under the beads grew,
		They dreamed in the distance behind the smoke
		A cheerful mowing over the meadows.

		Oh you, Rus', my meek homeland,
		Only for you I save love.
		Your short joy is merry
		With a loud song in the spring in the meadow.

US

		Not white snow over the Don
		They swept the steppe with a blue ringing.
		Under a steep mountain, what is under the tyn,
		The mother parted with her faithful son.

		"Farewell, my son, farewell, child,
		You know it's time to go!
		Zahirel our valley over the Don,
		Under the heel of Moscow, under the blanket .

		That is not a water ringing behind Putin -
		A horse beats its hoof under an aspen.
		Under the blushing slumber, under the bedrock
		Her son answered her in the end:

		"Don't stand, don't cry on the road,
		Light a candle, pray to God.
		I will collect the Don, I will spin the whirlwind,
		I will take the king, we will remove it famously.

		It was not the river that foamed into the hillock -
		He took out a knife from his knee,
		He cut off his black mustache from his lip,
		Spoke words over the oak forest:

		"You, my mother, dove,
		Save your mustache in the goddess;
		Sprinkle it with red bells
		Put him under the icon!"

		Gikal-uha he was under the fog,
		Dust was rising behind the mound.
		And she replied, how not happy:
		"Are you my son, my child!"

		*

		On a steep mountain, near Kaluga,
		Us got married with a blue blizzard.
		He lies in the snow under a spruce,
		With fun, revelry, with a hangover.

		Before him in all the nobility and the boyars,
		In the hands of golden charms.
		"Do not disdain, Us, do not be angry,
		Get up, take a sip, try it!

		We drew red wines
		From your high breasts.
		How drunk your wife is with them,
		White-haired blizzard girl!

		Mustache is silent, does not cast a glance, -
		He doesn't want anything from the land.
		He wonders about another land,
		Sighs about other skies...

		*

		The decrepit widow was waiting for her son,
		Day and night grieving, sitting under the goddess.
		Now the second summer has passed,
		Snow on the field again, but it's still gone .

		Came up, looked out the cloudy window ...
		"You are not alone in the field, path!"
		The falcon-wind whistles, the quiet Don raves.
		"It would be nice to snuggle up to the golden icons..."

		She sat down and pressed herself, looking meekly, meekly ...
		"What do you look like, bright-eyed lad? ..
		A! Tears glistened over a withered mustache. -
		It is you, my son, who is watching with Jesus!"

		She shines with joy from the corner.
		She sang the song and took the comb.

		Her senile face is affectionate and strict.
		Get up, sit down at the stove, on the threshold.

		The evening is frosty, like a wolf, dark brown ...
		Calls chickens and fluffy chickens:

		"Chicks-chicks, light-cockerel! .."
		The horn comb is strong in the hand.

		She stood, stared her forehead into the darkness,
		Combing the hair of the Christ child.

GRANDMA'S TALES

		Backyard on a winter evening
		A rollicking gur fight
		On snowdrifts, on hillocks
		We're going, we're going home.
		The sleds are disgusting,
		And we sit in two rows
		Listen to grandmother's tales
		About Ivan the Fool.
		And we sit, barely breathing.
		The time is running towards midnight.
		Let's pretend we don't hear
		If mom calls to sleep.
		All stories. Time for bed...
		But how can you sleep now?
		And again we roared,
		We start to get on.
		Grandma will say timidly:
		"Why sit until dawn?"
		Well, what do we care -
		Speak to speak.

		1914 - 1915


SWAN

		Because of the forest, the forest is dark,
		The red dawn rose,
		Scattered with a clear rainbow
		Lights-rays crimson.

		Lit up with a bright flame
		Pines old, mighty,
		Dressed up coniferous nets
		Covered in gold woven.

		And all around pearl dew
		She cast scarlet sparkles,
		And over the silver lake
		The reeds leaned over and whispered.

		This morning with the sun
		Is it from those dark thickets
		Came out like a dawn,
		White swan.

		Behind a gang of slender
		The swans moved.
		And the mirror surface was crushed
		On the rings are emerald.

		And from that quiet backwater,
		In the middle of that lake
		A distant stream passed
		Ribbon dark and wide.

		A white swan swam away
		On the other side of the expanse,
		Where to the silent backwater
		Silk grass lay down.

		On the green coast
		Tilting gentle heads,
		whispered lilies
		With silent streams.

		As the swan began to call
		Their little swans
		Take a walk in the colorful meadow,
		Pinch fragrant grass.

		The swans came out
		Pull grass-ant,
		And silver dewdrops
		Like pearls, crumbled.

		And around the flowers are azure
		Dissolved waves spicy
		And, like foreign guests,
		Smiling at a happy day.

		And the little children were walking
		Along the wide expanse,
		And the winch is snow-white,
		Without taking his eyes off, he watched.

		Did the kite fly through the grove,
		Or the snake crawled across the plain,
		The white swan cackled,
		Calling the little kids.

		The swans were buried
		Is it under the wing of the mother,
		And when the storm hid
		Again they ran and frolicked.

		But the swan did not feel
		I did not see with a brilliant eye,
		What is golden from the sun
		A black cloud was approaching -

		Young eagle under the cloud
		Spread the mighty wing
		And cast lightning eyes
		To the endless plain.

		He saw by the dark forest,
		On a hillock near a crevasse,
		Like a snake crawled out into the sun
		And curled into a ring, basking.

		And the eagle wanted with malice
		Like an arrow to the ground to rush,
		But the snake noticed him
		And hid under a bump.

		With a wave of his wings under the cloud
		He spread his sharp claws
		And, waiting for prey,
		Measurement in the air flattened .

		But his eyes are eagle
		We saw the steppe in the distance,
		And by the wide lake
		He saw a white swan.

		Terrible wave of the mighty wing
		Driven away the gray cloud
		And the eagle, like a black dot,
		He began to descend to the ground in rings.

		At this time the swan is white
		Og looked at the mirror surface
		And reflected in the sky
		I saw long wings.

		The swan fluttered
		Shouted to the swans,
		Small children gathered
		And buried under the wings.

		And the eagle flapping its wings
		Like an arrow rushed to the ground,
		And sharp claws dug
		Right in the neck of a swan.

		She spread her white wings
		snow white swan
		And dead feet
		Pushed the little kids away.

		The children ran to the lake,
		Rushed into the dense thickets,
		And from the eyes of a mother
		Bitter tears rolled down.

		And the eagle with sharp claws
		Tore apart her tender body,
		And white feathers flew
		Like spray, in all directions.

		The lake swayed quietly
		The reeds, bending down, whispered,
		And under the green bumps
		The swans were buried.

		1914 - 1915


QUEEN

		Spicy evening . Dawns go out.
		Fog creeps on the grass
		At the wattle fence on the slope
		Your sundress has turned white.

		In the spell of the stars
		The poplars were dumbfounded.
		I know you're waiting queen
		Young King.

		Rocker two-horned sickle
		Glides smoothly across the sky.
		There, behind the grove, along the road
		There is a sound of hooves.

		The tanned rider gallops,
		Holds the reins firmly.
		He will take you boldly
		In alien cities.

		Spicy evening. Dawns go out.
		The clear snoring of a horse is heard.
		Ah, stay on the slope
		Queen at the fence.

		1914 - 1915


DELETE

		Oh, I can't sit at home
		Swing to the war.
		I'll fly like a fast bird
		On a savras horse.

		Do not cry, mother and aunt,
		Tears dry the daredevil.
		gave me a beauty
		Two silver rings.

		Eh, I'll get her a lance
		Fur warmer.
		May from great joy
		Goes to the groom at night.

		You burn, my lightning,
		I am not afraid of the enemy's camp.
		The spoiled girl will kiss,
		How can I buy her a sundress.

		Why do you whine, women,
		I can't get in.
		Ali, these hands are weak,
		That the pawn is bent into an arc.

		will be cheerful to the grave,
		Deleted head.
		Follow me, sweetheart,
		Yes, keep your words.

AUTUMN

R. V. Ivanov

		Quiet in the thicket of juniper along the cliff.
		Autumn - a red mare - scratches her manes.

		Above the river bank
		Her blue clang is heard under the carpet.

		Schemnik-wind with a cautious step
		Creasing leaves on road ledges

		And kisses on the rowan bush
		Red ulcers to the invisible Christ.
		1914 - 1916

		Evening is like soot
		It pours out the window.
		white yarn
		Weaving cloth.

		The extinguisher is dancing,
		Jumping shadow.
		Knocking on the windows
		Old wattle.

		Sticking to the window
		Black path.
		baby girl
		Baika mother.

		The unsteady growls
		Sleepy troparion:
		"Sleep, my fish,
		Sleep, don't goof."

		1914-1916


* * *

		Hides the moon behind the sheep
		Yellow face from the bright sun .
		High above the meadows
		There is a glow in the east.
		The dawn fogs up with foam,
		Like the depths of the eyes of a bride.
		Spring has come like a wanderer
		With a staff in birch bark sandals.
		On the birches in the shady grove
		Hung ringing earrings
		And with the dawn in hell with lilac
		A moth fluttered merrily.

		1914-1916

		"Through the forest, the goblin shouts at an owl ..."
		Through the forest, the goblin shouts at an owl,
		Midges hide from birds in the grass.
		Ay!
		The bear sleeps, and it seems to her:
		The hunter stabs sharp children.
		Ay!
		She cries and shakes her head.
		- Children, children, go home.
		Ay!
		A ringing echo screams into the blue:
		- Hey you, answer me, who am I calling!
		Ay!

		1914-1916


THRESHING

		Grandpa left early
		Threshing on the threshing floor:
		"Come out, neighbor,
		Help the old man."

		Put in a crowd
		Golden sheaves.
		On the threshing floor
		The chains rang.

		And the grandfather turns
		Non-milled edge:
		"Knock, neighbor,
		Knock out the loaf."

		And under a strong hand
		The grain is flying out.
		Here and malt with flour,
		And wine for the wedding.

		Behind a heavy plow
		This share is given.
		Tuchen ear dry -
		The brew will be intoxicated.

Poems of 1915



SONG ABOUT THE DOG

		In the morning in a rye nook,
		Where the bast mats are golden in a row,
		Seven puppies bitch
		Red seven puppies.

		Until the evening she caressed them,
		combing your tongue ,
		And the snow was falling
		Under her warm belly.

		And in the evening when the chickens
		They sit around the sixth
		The owner came out gloomy,
		He put all seven in a bag.

		She ran through the snowdrifts,
		Running after him...
		And so long, long trembling
		Unfrozen waters .

		And when I trudged back a little,
		Licking sweat from the sides
		A month appeared to her over the hut
		One of her puppies.

		In the blue heights loudly
		She looked, whining,
		And the moon slid thin
		And disappeared behind the hill in the fields.

		And deaf, as from a handout,
		When they throw a stone at her in laughter,
		The eyes of a dog rolled
		Golden stars in the snow.

		1915


BIRD BIRTHDAY

		Fragrant bird cherry
		Bloomed with spring
		And golden branches
		What curls, curled.
		Honey dew all around
		Slips down the bark
		Spicy greens underneath
		Shines in silver.
		And next to the thawed patch,
		In the grass, between the roots,
		Runs, flows small
		Silver stream.
		Fragrant bird cherry,
		Hanging out, standing
		And the green is golden
		Burning in the sun.
		Brook with a thundering wave
		All branches are covered
		And insinuatingly under the steep
		She sings songs.
		1915


* * *

		O child, I wept for a long time over your fate,
		Every night I yearn more and more, more and more ...

		I know, I know, soon, soon, at sunset,
		They will carry me with grave singing to bury me ...

		You will see from the window a white sav an mine,
		And your heart will shrink from mute longing ...

		Oh child, I wept for a long time with the secret of warm words,
		And my tears froze into beads of pearls ...

		And I knitted a necklace for you from them,
		You put it on your neck in memory of my days!

		1915


beggar

		girl is crying at the window of a large choir,
		And in the mansions, merry laughter flows like silver.
		The girl cries and freezes in the wind of autumn thunderstorms,
		And with a chilled hand he wipes away drops of tears.

		With tears she asks for a piece of stale bread,
		The head of the sedge freezes from resentment and excitement .
		But in the mansions this voice drowns out the noise of comfort,
		And the little one stands, crying to a cheerful, frisky laugh.

		1915


GREECE

		Mighty Achilles smashed the strongholds of Troy.
		The brilliant Patroclus, slain, was dying.
		And Hector wiped his sword on the grass
		And he poured blooming levkoy on the enemy.

		Soybeans mournfully flew over the ashes with weeping,
		And the lunar crescent broke through the network of tunics.
		Tired Achilles fell to the ground,
		He carried the slain to his native chambers.

		Ah, Greece! dream of my soul!
		You are a gentle fairy tale, but I am more tender to you,
		Tender than to Hector, the hero, Andromache.

		Take your sword. Be Serbia's sister.
		Remind the world of fallen Troy,
		And for the vandals, let the sword and chopping block blacken.
		1915


POLAND

		A bloody cloud hung over Poland,
		And red drops burn cities.
		But a star shines in the glow of past centuries.
		The Vistula is crying under the pink wave.

		In the ring of times with one shade of meaning
		All years fit the scales of war.
		And the winner for the banner of his labor
		The enemy himself puts flowers on the cups of the yoke.

		Oh Poland, bright dream in the damp prison of Kosciuszki,
		Slave in splinters of halo.
		I see your Mickiewicz loading guns.

		You have torn open the network of captivity with a powerful hand.
		Let the native edges of the edge burn,
		But the ringing of victories is heard at the prayer service of the church.

		1915


OLD WOMEN

		Under the window old women are dancing.
		Their shrill wheeze breaks the silence.
		From a block of wood, like pitched beads, flies
		They fly away to the shushun forest.
		Grandmothers look in black oak forests,
		Where the lightning bolts sparkle,
		Poke motley ponevs
		And goggle eyelids without eyelashes.
		"To be raining," they decide in gossip, "
		The sky is in a smoke, like a gloomy near.
		After all, it's not for nothing that on the dishes
		There was a sour mucus,
		Not in vain sour on the shawls
		Fresh milk in the cellars
		And the youngsters don't get so fucked up,
		It can be seen that it is not easy for the poor to breathe."
		The old women talk about the prophet
		What drives horses in the sky
		And all around in a smoky haze
		It blows with the raw material of ringing rains.
		1915


* * *

		At the porch there is tar in a thin log.
		Black jets loosened up like snakes.
		Chickens go to touch black snakes
		And in the manure they clean their sticky beak.
		In the rattletrap there is a prickly weed,
		Without wheels, like paws, the axles look.
		The old grandfather straightens the kingpin on the sleeve,
		As if a scythe is hollowed out on a mowing.
		At the cellar with the uterus of pigs,
		Next to the mixture is a rotten pelvis.
		Under the wing on a crumpled past
		A mushy kanka catches lice .
		Under the mountain, a herd jumps on the swill.
		Weeping sheep with bready munch.
		The shepherds are singing over the fence:
		"Kyt kyrya!" - and snap the rope.
		1915


CITY

		Keeping the covenant of native beliefs -
		Feed shameful fear of sin,
		I wandered in a stone cave ,
		Like a tempted monk.
		How ants swarm people
		From the cracks of hollowed-out blocks,
		And, grimacing, their breasts moved,
		What are the scales of scrawny fish.
		It was so loud in my soul
		In diapers of stone and flint.
		On every lane lane
		The cow's roar groaned .
		Drizzhal drogi, like glass,
		Distance threatened with a whip in the face,
		And the sky was gloomy and faded,
		Like a woman's worn shawl.
		With a smile of snake sin
		Girlish laughter beckoned me
		But I kept the covenant of baptism -
		Spit with a prayer to Satan.
		How about a knife and a steel road
		Boots were torn on the stones,
		And I heard a call from God:
		"Forget what you saw and run!"

Rurik Ivnev

		I'll dress you up as a beggar
		I will gird with a trimmed bast.
		Resting with a thick club,
		You go to the forest dodder.

		At the haystacks of dry boletus
		A mermaid sews from new leaves.
		Her lips are redder than raspberries
		Eyebrows are black steeper than a horseshoe.

		You tell her: "I'm a tired wanderer,
		Indifferent to worldly losses.
		Throw off, leave your faded coat,
		Go with her to the thickets in the tower.

		Mermaids will gather with flowers,
		They will lead a spree to the accordion
		And you at dawn with roosters
		They will take you to the clearing.

		You will wander, perked up,
		You will yell pribaski on the tsevne
		And towards the hunchbacked old women
		Throw off your hat with a bow to the village.

		March 29, 1915


HEN-PARTY

		I'll wear a red monisto
		I will loop the sundress with a blue ruffle.
		Call, girls, accordionist,
		Say goodbye to your sweet friend.

		My fiance, sullen and jealous,
		Doesn't tell you to look at guys.
		I will sing to such a lonely,
		Well you dance fractional and fumes.

		How sad the girl's loss
		It is sad to live a mourned bride.
		The groom will take me out the door,
		Will ask about maiden honor.

		Ah, girlfriends, ashamed and embarrassing:
		A timid heart is covered with a cold.
		It's hard to talk to a sister-in-law
		It is better to live unhappy, but without a husband.

		1915

		On azure fabrics
		Spilled fingers crimson.
		In a dark grove, across a clearing,
		The bell is crying with laughter.

		The hollows are clouded
		Moss covered with silver.
		Through the spinners and ovs
		It seems the month is a white horn.

		On the road famously, smartly,
		Waving foamy sweat,
		Riding a crazy trio
		To the village in a round dance.

		The girls look slyly
		At the handsome man through the fence.
		The guy is brave, curly
		Breaks his hat on one side.

		Brighter than a pink shirt
		The dawns of spring are burning.
		Gilded plaques
		They speak with bells.

		1915


* * *

		I am a miserable wanderer.
		With the evening star
		I sing about God
		Kasatka steppe.

		On a silk platter
		fall of aspens,
		Listen people
		Whoops of quagmire.

		Wide into the meadows
		Kissing the pine
		Sing fast
		About paradise and spring.

		I am a miserable wanderer,
		I pray in the blue
		On the fallen road
		I lie down in the grass.

		I rest sweetly
		Between dewy beads;
		Lamp in the heart
		And in the heart of Jesus.

		1915


ROBBER

		The stars will die out, the month will die out,
		The song of the nightingale subsides,
		In Chernobyl Perelesitsa
		I will sit down with a brush.

		By the river under the slope
		Do not quit, fisherman, lure,
		On the road dark forest
		Do not count, merchant, the treasury!

		Grasping hands, grasping hands,
		Not in vain I'm called grip:
		I'll grab the brocade and the tubs ,
		Dear, I'll take off my bathrobe.

		In a dark grove a robin
		She combs a strand of hair with spruce;
		Help me out, scissor:
		There is a clatter of wheels.

		Do not get to know stupid people
		Where did he save and keep money;
		Want - so we'll get everything
		Dark night in the meadow!

		1915


DANCER

		You play, accordion, under the snaffle,
		Sleep, dancer, fraction!
		A monogram is reddening on a scarf,
		Know click, do not be shy!

		The guy is brave, blue-eyed
		Looked not at laughter.
		Your leprosy are merry,
		The sleeve is like snow.

		Smiling old ladies
		around .
		Watch with envy girlfriends
		On silk braids.

		Have fun, dance fumes,
		Wave the border of the veil.
		Tomorrow night from the guys
		Matchmakers and matchmakers will come.

		1915


RUSI

		I weave a wreath for you alone,
		I sprinkle gray stitch with flowers.
		Oh Russia, bye corner,
		I love you, and I believe in you.
		I look into the expanse of your fields,
		You are all near and far.
		Akin to me the whistle of cranes
		And the slippery path is not alien.
		The swamp font blooms,
		Kuga calls for a long vespers,
		And drops ring through the bushes
		Dew cold and healing.
		And even though your fog drives away
		The stream of winds blowing with wings,
		But all of you are myrrh and Lebanese
		Magi, secretly sorcerers.

		Brought in by a stray bird
		Funeral news for us.
		Motherland, black nun,
		Reads psalms for sons.

		Red threads of the hourbook
		The words were covered in blood.
		I know you are ready to die
		But your death will be alive.

		In the church for a quiet mass
		I will take out the prosphora for you,
		Pray for the last breath
		And a tear from the cheek in the morning.

		And you are from a bright paradise,
		In robes whiter than day,
		Baptize as if dying
		For not loving me.

		1915


WITCH

		Braids are disheveled, terrible, white,
		Runs, runs, frisky, bold.
		The dark night is silently frightened,
		The moon is covered with shawls of clouds.
		Wind-singing n with a howl of hysterics
		Rushing into the dense forest wilderness.
		The grove threatens with spruce peaks,
		Owls hide with fearful cries.
		The sorceress waves her bony hands.
		The stars blink from the clouds above the oak forests.
		Snakes are hung with earrings under the braids,
		Spinning with a blizzard terribly and furiously.
		The sorceress dances to the sound of a pine forest.
		Clouds float with black trembling.

		1915


MERMAID UNDER THE NEW YEAR

		You don't love me dear dove
		You are not cooing with me, with another.
		Ah, I will go to the river under the mountain,
		I will rush from the shore into the black hole .

		No one will find my bones
		I'll be back as a mermaid in the spring.
		You will bring the horse to the watering place,
		And I will drink the horse from a handful.

		I'll sing to you quietly
		How I live as a princess, I yearn,
		I will lure you, I will enchant you,
		I'll take the horse into the jets by the withers!

		Oh, how the tower stands under water -
		There the little mermaids play hide-and-seek-
		He is made of ice, and the windows are konurki
		In gray frames they burn under mica.

		I will drag herbs on the bed,
		I will put you next to me.
		I will entertain you with my eyes,
		I kiss you, caress you!

		1915


Wake

		They shielded the willows lonely
		Kosnik dead dwellings.
		Like snow, kolyvo turns white -
		In memory of the heavenly birds food.

		Jackdaws are dragging lean rice from the graves,
		Beggars knit over bags of twine.
		Mothers and godmothers lament,
		Brides and sisters-in-law are singing.

		Over stones, over a thick layer of dust,
		Hops curl, tangled and sticky.
		Long pop in skinny stole
		Picks up black pennies.

		Under the turn for a modest alms
		Wanderers are looking for an inveterate grave.
		And the deacon sings for remembrance:
		"Servant of the dead, Lord , have mercy."

		1915


GRANDFATHER

		Dry felt along the stitches
		Loosened litter in the grass,
		At Humen for burdock brooches
		A fly dance sticks.

		Old grandfather, bending his back,
		Cleans the trampled current
		And bottom chaff
		Burrows into a corner.

		Squinting at the cloudy eye,
		He cuts the burdock.
		Digging with a scraper along the groove
		Bypass circle from rains.

		Shards in the fire of gold coins.
		Grandfather - as in zhamkovo mica,
		And the bunny of the sun plays
		In a reddish beard.

		1915


* * *

		White scroll and scarlet sash
		I tear through the beds for the flushed poppy.

		A round dance rings loudly outside the village,
		There she is, there she sings songs.

		I remember how I shouted, shooing into the log house:
		"Well, you are beautiful, but you are not loved by the heart.

		Rings of your curls burns with winds,
		My eastern comb protects the other.

		I know what is alien to her and why I am not nice:
		I danced less and drank the least.

		Meekly I stood sadly against the wall:
		They were all singing and drunk.

		His happiness is that he has less shame,
		His beard climbed into her neck.

		Twisted with him in a burning dance ring,
		She burst out laughing in my face.

		White scroll and scarlet sash
		I tear the blushing poppy along the beds.

		Poppy love heart blooms ...
		But she doesn't sing songs to me.

		1915


* * *

		Our faith is not extinguished
		Holy songs and psalms.
		pouring sun oil
		To green hills.

		I believe, motherland, and I know
		How light is your foot
		Not one leads us to paradise
		Prayer path.

		All your ways are in luck
		But there is no happiness in only one:
		He is chained in white weeping
		Unraveling a new world.

		There are chambers
		From church bricks;
		Those chambers are casemates
		Yes, the iron ring of chains.

		Do not look for me in God
		Do not call to love and live ...
		I will go down that road
		Lay down your head.

TO MY PRINCESS

		<SONNET>

		I cried at dawn, when the distances faded,
		When the night made a dewy bed ,
		And with a whisper, the waves of sobs died away,
		And somewhere in the distance they were echoed by a flute.

		A wave said to me: "We are yearning in vain,"
		And, throwing off her cover, she buried herself in the banks,
		And the pale sickle of the moon with a cold kiss
		With a smile, he chilled my tears into pearls.

		And I brought you, clear-eyed princess,
		Coral tears of my lonely sadness
		And a gentle veil of foamy waves.

		But the drunken heart of my love is not happy ...
		Give me everything that I don't need
		Give me a kiss for a kiss of the moon.

		A fragrant fog lit up.
		I'm driving down the dirt road from the station

		The forest froze without sadness and noise,
		Darkness hangs like a handkerchief behind a pine tree.
		A weeping thought gnaws at the heart ...
		Oh, you are not cheerful, my native land.

		And my coachman sings on-umyak:

		Bagels hang on wattle fences,
		Bread brew pours warmth.
		Sun planed shingles
		Illuminate blue.

		Booths, stumps and stakes,
		Kar uselny whistle.
		From the whirlwind
		Grasses are bent, leaves are wrinkled.

		The rumble of hooves and the wheezing of the merchants,
		The drunken smell of honeycombs.
		Beware, if not dexterous:
		The whirlwind will sweep away the dust.

		For bream antimony -
		A woman's cry, like in the morning.
		Isn't it your shawl
		Green in the wind?

		Oh, daring and verbose

		In the land where the yellow nettle
		And dry wattle
		Sheltered to the willows lonely
		Huts of villages.

		There in the fields, behind the blue thicket of the log,
		In the green of the lakes
		The sandy road
		to the Siberian mountains.

		Lost Rus' in Mordva and Chud,
		She has no fear.
		And people go down that road
		People in shackles.

		They are all murderers or thieves
		As fate judged them.
		I loved their sad eyes
		With hollow cheeks.

		Much evil with joy in murderers,
		Their hearts are simple
		But grimacing in blackened faces
		Blue mouths.

		I have one dream, hiding, I care,
		That I am pure in heart.
		But I will kill someone
		Under the autumn whistle.

		And I'm blown by the wind,
		By that sand
		Lead with a rope around your neck
		Love sadness.

		And when with a smile in passing
		I will straighten my chest
		Bad weather
		lived my way.

COW

		decrepit, teeth fell out,
		Scroll of years on the horns.
		Beat her rude kicker
		In the driving fields.

		The heart is unkind to the noise,
		Mice scratch in the corner.
		Thinks sad luma
		About the white-footed heifer.

		They did not give the mother a son,
		The first joy is not for the future.
		And on a stake under an aspen
		The breeze fluttered the skin.

		Soon on the buckwheat
		With the same filial fate
		Tie a noose around her neck
		And lead to the slaughter.

		Mournful, sad and skinny
		Horns pierce the ground...
		She dreams of a white grove
		And grassy meadows.

HERD

		In the hills of green herds of horses
		They blow away with their nostrils the golden plaque from the days.

		From a high mound to a blue bay
		The pitch of the swaying manes fell.

		Shaking their heads over still water,
		And catches the moon with their silver bridle .

		Snoring in fright at my own shadow
		Zazastit manes they are waiting for a new day

		*

		Spring day rings over the horse's ear
		With affable desire to the first flies.

		But by evening the horses over the meadows
		They kick and flap their ears.

		All the sharper ringing, stuck on the hooves,
		It sinks in the air, it hangs on the willows.

		And only the wave will reach for the star,
		Flies flicker ashes on the water.

		The sun went out. Quiet on the lawn.
		The shepherd plays a song on the horn.

		Staring foreheads, listening to the herd,
		What the swirling din young sings to them .

		And the echo is frisky, gliding over their lips,
		Carries their thoughts to unknown meadows.

		Loving your day and night darkness,
		For you, O motherland, I composed that song.

		Scarlet darkness in the sky black
		He drew the line with fire.
		I have come to your vespers,
		Field of wilderness.

		My cat is not easy,
		But the eyes are blue of the day.
		I know mother earth blueberries
		We are all close relatives.

		We parted into the distance and wide
		Under the azure wing.
		But will call us from the psalter
		Dawn dawn psalm.

		And we will come across the plains
		To the truth of the sewn cross
		By the light of a dove book
		Drink your mouth.

		The three-blizzard played out,
		Sweat splashes, cold, tart,
		And weeping bream
		Climbs to the wind on the backs.

		Death in the dark sharpens the razor...
		Look, Magdalene is crying.

MYKOLA

		1

		In the cap of a cloudy cleavage,
		In paws, like a shadow,
		Merciful Mikola walks
		Past villages and villages.

		On his shoulders is a knapsack,
		Drawstring in two braids,
		He walks, sings softly
		Jordanian psalms.

		Evil sorrows, evil grief
		Dal cold drank;
		Light up like dawn
		Domes in the blue sky.

		Tilting your meek face,
		A row of weeping willows slumbers,
		And like a silk rosary
		Branch beaded twist.

		A gentle servant walks
		Unctuous sweat pours from the face:
		"Oh you, my forest, choir leader,
		Lull the stranger."

		2

		Betrothed around
		Grove of firs and birches.
		Through the bushes in the green meadow
		Flakes of blue dew are falling.

		The cloud split with a shadow
		Green hillside...
		Washing Mykola
		White foam from the lakes.

		Under the birch-bride,
		For with an eared cooper,
		Wiped off with birch bark,
		Like a soft towel.

		And walks unhurried foot
		By villages, wastelands:
		"I, a resident of a foreign country,
		I'm going to the monasteries."

		Evil grass stands high,
		Ergot incense mist:
		"I'll pray for my health
		Orthodox Christians".

		3

		A wanderer walks along the roads,
		Where is his name in trouble,
		And from the earth he speaks with God
		In a white cloud-beard.

		The Lord speaks from the throne
		Opening the window for paradise:
		"O my faithful servant, Mikola,
		Go around the Russian region.

		Protect there in black troubles
		Sorrow-torn people.
		Pray with him for victories
		And for their poor comfort.

		A wanderer walks through taverns,
		He says, seeing the gathering:
		"I have come to you, brothers, in peace -
		Heal the sadness of worries.

		Your souls to the road
		Pulls suma with a staff .
		Gather God's Grace
		Ripe rye in the bins.

		4

		The bitter smell of black burning,
		Autumn groves set on fire.
		Collects the wanderer of creatures,
		Feeds with millet from the hem.

		"Oh, goodbye, white birds,
		Hide, animals, in the tower,
		Dark forest, - matchmakers tickle, -
		Marry the winter girl.

		There is a place for everyone, there are logs for everyone,
		Open, earth, their chest!
		I am a longtime servant of the Gods,
		In God's tower I rule the way.

		Ringing marble of white stairs
		Stretched into the Garden of Eden;
		Like a cosmos of sorceresses,
		Stars hang in the apple trees .

		On the throne shines brighter
		In scarlet robes, the meek Savior.
		"Mikolae the Wonderworker,
		Pray to him for us."

		5

		The dawns cover the heavenly tower,
		At the window of the Mother of God
		Pigeons call to the door
		Grainy pecking rye.

		"Peck, angelic birds:
		Kolos is a life flight.
		More fragrant than lungwort
		It smells of merry sweat.

		The forest is decorated with lace,
		They ate like a bush.
		Through the hollows of black arable land -
		Snowflax yarn.

		Having rolled up the floors with rye,
		The plowman is shaking the husk,
		In honor of the saint Mikola
		Sow rye in the snow.

		And, as if on the grass of the okosya
		In the evening mowing
		Ears ring in the snow
		Under the scythes of birches.

FOX

A. M. Remizov

		I hobbled on a shattered leg,
		At the hole, she curled up into a ring.
		Thin stitched blood separated
		There is a different face in the snow .

		She was all flaunted in prickly smoke shot,
		The forest swamp swayed in the eyes.
		From the bushes a shaggy wind whipped up
		And scattered the ringing fraction.

		How yellow, the darkness rushed over her,
		The wet evening was sticky and scarlet.
		Head raised anxiously
		And the tongue on the wound froze.

		The yellow tail fell into the blizzard like a fire,
		On the lips - like rotten carrots ...
		It smelled of hoarfrost and clay waste,
		And blood oozed quietly into his eyes.

		1915


* * *

		Behind the dark strand of copses,
		In unshakable blue
		Curly lamb - a month
		Walking in the blue grass.

		In a quiet lake with sedge
		His horns butt,
		And it seems from a distant path -
		Water shakes the banks.

		And the steppe under the green canopy
		Census bird cherry smoke
		And beyond the valleys on the slopes
		Weaves a frying pan over him.

		On the side of the feather grass forest,
		You are close to my heart,
		But even in yours lurks thicker
		Salt sadness.

		And you, like me, in a sad need,
		Forgetting who is your friend and enemy,
		You miss the pink sky
		And dove clouds.

		But to you from the blue expanse
		Darkness seems timid
		And the shackles of your Siberia
		And the hump of the Ural Range.

		1915- 1916




Poems of 1916



* * *

		I'm tired of living in my native land
		In longing for buckwheat expanses,
		Leave my hut
		I will leave as a vagabond and a thief.

		I'll walk through the white curls of the day
		And say a wretched dwelling.
		And my beloved friend
		He sharpens a knife for the bootleg.

		Spring and sunshine on the meadow
		entwined yellow road
		And the one whose name I keep
		I will be driven from the threshold.

		And I will return to my father's house again,
		I will be comforted by someone else's joy,
		In the green evening under the window
		I will hang myself on my sleeve.

		Gray willows at the wattle fence
		Gently bow their heads.
		And unwashed me
		Under the barking of a dog will be buried.

		And the month will swim and swim,
		Dropping oars across the lakes...
		And Rus' will still live,
		Dance and cry at the fence.

		1916 _


* * *

		Beyond the mountains, beyond the yellow valleys
		The path of the villages stretched.
		I see the forest and the evening fire,
		And wattle entwined with nettles.

		There in the morning over the church domes
		Blue sky sand
		And ringing roadside herbs
		Water breeze from the lakes.

		Not for the songs of spring over the plain
		The road to me is green expanse -
		I fell in love with a longing crane
		Monastery on a high mountain.

		Every evening, as the blue becomes cloudy,
		As the dawn hangs on the bridge,
		You go, my poor wanderer,
		Bow down to love and the cross.

		Gentle is the spirit of the monastic dweller,
		You eagerly listen to the litany,
		Pray before the face of the savior
		For my lost soul.

		1916


* * *

		The moon butts the cloud with its horn,
		Bathed in blue dust.
		Tonight no one will guess
		Why did the cranes cry?

		This night to the green backwater
		She came running from the reeds.
		Golden braids by tunic
		Scattered by a white hand.

		She ran, looked nimble into the stream,
		She sank down on a stump in pain.
		And in the eyes withered daisies,
		Like a swamp light goes out.

		At dawn with a curling mist
		She swam away and disappeared into the distance ...
		And the month behind the mound nodded to her,
		Bathed in blue dust.

		1916


* * *

		Spread patterned again
		Crimson over the white field,
		And pours fervently
		Nizhny Novgorod bell.

		Under the foggy haze
		You say girlish beauty
		And the wind ruffles under the scarf
		Red haired braid.

		The arc, splitting, dances,
		Now emerging, then disappearing,
		Won't bewitch, won't fool
		Your painted sleeve.

		For a long time I began to dream
		Fields crimson expanse,
		You - a high light ,
		And to me - a distant monastery.

		There is blue and a fire of air
		And a lighter veil.
		I will be an affectionate novice
		And you are a wild wife.

		And I know we'll both be
		To mourn in resilient silence:
		I follow you - in a dense fog,
		And you will cry for me .

		But even having understood, I do not accept
		No quiet caresses, no depth -
		Eyes that see the earth
		In love with another land.

		1916


DREAM

		(From the book Love Poems)

		1

		In a dark grove on green firs
		Leaves of sluggish willows are golden.
		I go out to the high shore
		Where the bay splashes calmly.

		Two moons, shaking their horns,
		The swell was clouded with yellow smoke.
		The surface of the lakes with grass without distinguishing,
		Quietly crying bittern in the swamp.

		In this voice of a mowed meadow
		I hear a call familiar to my heart.
		You call me my friend
		Immerse yourself at sleepy shores.

		For many years I have not been here and for many
		I saw merry meetings and partings,
		But I always kept in myself strictly
		The gentle fold of your misty hands.

		Quiet boy, feeling meekly,
		Kissing doves on the mouth,
		Slim frame with a slow gait
		I loved in you, my dream.

		I wandered through towns and villages,
		I was looking for you where you live
		And with laughter, frisky and cheerful,
		Often you beckoned me to rye.

		Hiding behind the monastery fence,
		I once entered the white temple:
		Washing the sun with blue water ,
		His orarion was thrown at my feet.

		I stood, like a monk, in a scarlet brilliance,
		Silence suddenly gripped my throat...
		You entered under a black veil
		And, drooping, stood at the window.

		3

		From the porch to the buzzing bell
		You descended into the incense of the candles.
		And I could not, gently trembling,
		Do not touch your hands and shoulders.

		I wanted to tell you so much
		What tormented the soul from an early time,
		But the quiet road smoked
		In the unsunsetting hollow of the lakes.

		You looked quietly at the valleys,
		Where in the grass curly haze crawled ...
		And rare gray hairs fell
		From your withered brow...

		Slightly pale folds from clothes,
		And, it seemed in the course of dark waters, -
		Leaving chewed my hopes
		Your toothless, mumbling mouth.

		4

		But the cold did not torment the soul for long.
		Like a wing, clinging to her feet,
		A new box of feelings and I loaded
		And went to new shores.

		Without a seam, the wound tightened in the heart,
		The passion has gone out, and the love has gone.
		But again you came from the fog
		And she was beautiful and bright.

		You whispered, shielding your hand:
		"Look how young I am.
		This life frightened you and me,
		I am all like air and water.

		In the voices of the mowed meadow
		I hear a call familiar to my heart.
		You call me my friend
		To mourn at the sleepy shores.

		1916


* * *

		Blue sky, colored arc,
		Quietly steppe shores run,
		Smoke stretches, near small villages
		The wedding of the crows covered the palisade.

		Again I see a familiar cliff
		With red clay and willow branches,
		Dreaming over the lake red oats,
		It smells of chamomile and honey from wasps.

		My end! Beloved Rus' and Mordva!
		By the parable of darkness, you are alive, as before.
		Gently under the flutter of angel wings
		Ringing crosses of nameless graves.

		Many you, motherland, with your face
		Burned and languished in the mines damp.
		Many dreams of them, strong and evil,
		Bite your perseus berries.

		Only I believe: do not survive that
		Who stopped loving your jail and prison ...
		Eternal truth and the hubbub of the forests
		Delight the soul under the ringing of shackles.

		1916


* * *

		Farewell, dear forest,
		Sorry, golden spring.
		Clouds float and break
		O solar coulter.

		Shine on, good day
		And I want to be sad.
		Knife behind the boot
		I don't wear anymore.

		Under the belly of a foal
		In the dead of night do not sleep
		And ringing with joy
		Lesov not to announce.

		And avoid the storm
		Don't miss the loss
		To ring out in the blue
		Ring of invisible gates.

		1916


* * *

		Listen, filthy heart,
		heart .
		I'm on you like a thief
		He hid the blade in his hands.

		Whether sooner or later I will plant
		Cold steel in the ribs.
		No, I cannot strive
		In the eternal rotten distance.

		Let them talk dumber
		That they were bitten by meta;
		If there is anything in the world -
		This is one void.

Malvina Mironovna - S. Yesenin

		In the eyes of the sands are green
		And clouds.
		According to the lace
		The hand slips.
		Now close, now far,
		Always like this.
		Her sad fate
		My trouble.
		July 9, 1916


* * *

		The sky is smeared with sour cream,
		A month is like a piece of cheese.
		Just not related to food
		Heart, sore spot.

		I want to eat, but not this,
		What's so annoying to the teeth.
		I'm waiting for a cheerful, bright,
		Like a young destiny

		Burning desires multiply
		My sick soul
		But they will put me on the coffin
		Cool kutya with kvass.

JESUS BABY

		Collected by the Most Pure
		Cranes with tits
		In the temple:

		"Sing, be merry
		And pray for everyone
		With us!"

		Pray with bows
		For a sinful fate
		For ours;

		And a little God,

		Eating porridge.

		The tit came up
		trouble bird,
		Asked:

		"I am to you, God,
		Tired legs,
		Prayed."

		Crane and say at once:
		"You and feed us,
		Kohl created.

		And our God
		Shared their porridge
		And gave.

		In a gilded house
		Looks Mother of God
		Into the sky.

		And the little son
		Asks on the mound
		Of bread.

		Called the Most Pure
		Cranes with tits
		Said:

		"Bring, birds,
		Bread and wheat
		Not a little."

		The birds lingered
		Cranes, tits -
		Rain is predicted.

		And the Goddess is in the house
		Everything is pulling Mati,
		Wants to eat.

		The Mother of God came out
		In the field, outside
		Calls.

		Only the wind across the field
		Like horses stomping
		Whistle.

		God Little
		Cried on the mound
		From grief.

		Crying, drenched...
		A stork came here
		Whitefin.

		He took it carefully
		Red beak God,
		Rushed off.

		And the Lord on the Christmas tree
		In the stork's nest
		Rocked.

		Holy Mother -
		There is no son.

		And the white stork
		What 's with God

		Children."

		1916


* * *

		In the crimson glow, the sunset is effervescent and foamy,
		White birch trees burn in their crowns.
		My verse greets young princesses
		And youthful meekness in their tender hearts.

		Where shadows are pale and sorrowful torments,
		They are the one who went to suffer for us,
		Reigning arms extended
		Blessing them for the life to come.

		On a white bed, in a bright brilliance of light,
		Sobs the one whose life they want to return ...
		And the walls of the infirmary tremble
		About the pity that they squeeze their chest.

		Closer pulls them with an irresistible hand
		There, where grief puts a seal on the forehead.
		Oh, pray, holy Magdalene,
		For their fate.

		1916


* * *

		Without a hat, with a bast knapsack,
		Washing off your sweat like oil
		I wander on the side of the oak forest
		Under the quiet rustle of poplars.

		I walk, fastened with a rope,
		I sit under the mop on the meadow.
		I have a holey undershirt,
		And my guide is a setback.

		I sing a verse about a bright paradise,
		Satisfied with the thought that I live,
		And I throw juicy crumbs
		Forest pebbles on the grass.

		The stitches are washed on the burdock,
		In the distance, lake vitriol,
		I cling to sticky earrings
		Birches drooping to the ground.

		And through the bushes between the neighboring,
		Under the hooting owls,
		I listen, as if at dinner,
		Prayer of bird voices.

		1916


* * *

		The day is gone, the line has diminished,
		I went back to leaving.
		With a flick of a white finger
		Secrets of years I cut the water.

		In the blue stream of my destiny
		Scaling cold foam beats,
		And puts the seal of silent captivity
		A new crease on a wrinkled lip.

		Every day I become a stranger
		And to myself, and to whom I ordered life.
		Somewhere in a clean field, at the boundary,
		I tore my shadow from my body.

		She left undressed
		Taking my curved shoulders.
		Somewhere she's far away now
		And gently hugged the other.

		Maybe leaning towards him ,
		She completely forgot about me.
		And staring into the ghostly darkness,
		The folds of the lips and mouth have changed.

		But lives by the sound of former years,
		What, like an echo, wanders beyond the mountains.
		I kiss with blue lips
		Black shadow embossed portrait.

		1916


* * *

		I'm here again , in my own family,
		My land, thoughtful and gentle!
		Curly dusk behind the mountain
		The snow-white hand waves.

		Gray hair on a cloudy day
		Float disheveled past,
		And evening sadness me
		Irresistibly worried.

		Above the dome of the church domes
		The shadow of the dawn fell lower.
		O other games and amusements,
		I won't see you again!

		Years have sunk into oblivion
		And then you went somewhere.
		And only still water
		Noise behind the winged mill.

		And often I'm in the evening mist,
		To the sound of a broken sedge,
		I pray to the smoking earth
		About irrevocable and distant.

		1916


* * *

		In the green church behind the mountain
		Where the willow rosary was dropped,
		I commemorate with prosphora
		Young springs were young.

		And you, bowed down,
		Standing in front of me, invisible
		Silk of drooping eyelashes
		The wings of the Cherubim sway.

		Your white rock is not overshadowed
		Your frozen time
		Still the same pink handkerchief
		Tightened by a swarthy hand.

		All the same sigh resiliently presses
		Your broken shoulders
		About the one who lives beyond the sea
		And who is far from home.

		And the memory of the day is all the more viscous
		Before the decent face of life.
		Oh pray for me too
		For the homeless in the homeland.

		June 1916
		Konstantinovo


* * *

		The distance was shrouded in mist,
		The lunar crest scratches the clouds.
		Red evening behind the kukan
		Spread curly nonsense.

		Under the window from slippery winds
		Quail wind calls.
		Quiet dusk, warm angel,
		Filled with unearthly light.

		Sleep hut easily and evenly
		With grain spirit he sows parables.
		On dry straw in firewood
		Sweeter than honey is the sweat of a man.

		Someone's soft dashing behind the forest,
		Smells like cherries and moss om...
		Friend, comrade and peer,
		Pray for cow breaths.

		June 1916


* * *

		Do not wander, do not crush in the crimson bushes
		Swans and do not look for a trace.
		With a sheaf of your oatmeal hair
		You touched me forever.

		With scarlet berry juice on the skin,
		Tender, beautiful, was
		You look like a pink sunset
		And, like snow, radiant and bright.

		The grains of your eyes crumbled, withered,
		The thin name melted like a sound,
		But remained in the folds of a crumpled shawl
		The smell of honey from innocent hands.

		In a quiet hour, when the dawn is on the roof,
		Like a kitten, it washes its mouth with its paw,
		I hear a meek talk about you
		Water honeycombs singing with the wind.

		Let sometimes the blue evening whisper to me,
		That you were a song and a dream
		All the same, who invented your flexible frame and shoulders -
		He put his mouth to the bright secret.

		Do not wander, do not crush in the crimson bushes
		Swans and do not look for a trace.
		With a sheaf of your oatmeal hair
		You touched me forever.

		1916


* * *

		The road thought about the red evening,
		Bushes of mountain ash are more foggy than depth.
		Hut-old woman jaw threshold
		Chews the odorous crumb of silence.

		Autumn cold gently and meekly
		Creeps in the darkness to the oat yard;
		Through the blue glass yellow-haired boy
		He shines his eyes on the checkbox game.

		Embracing the pipe, sparkles along the tale
		Green ash from the pink oven.
		There is no one, and the thin-lipped wind
		about someone who has disappeared into the night.

		Someone's heels no longer crush the groves
		Cracked leaf and gold grass.
		A lingering sigh, diving with a skinny ringing,
		Kisses the beak of a fluffy owl.

		The darkness is thicker, in the barn there is peace and slumber,
		The white road patterns the slippery ditch...
		And the barley straw gently groans,
		Hanging from the lips of nodding cows.

		1916


DOVE

		In the transparent cold, the valleys turned blue,
		The sound of shod hooves is distinct,
		Grass faded into the spread floors
		Collects copper from weathered willows.

		From empty hollows it crawls in a skinny arc
		Raw mist curled curly into moss,
		And the evening, hanging over the river, rinses
		Water of white toes of blue feet.

		*

		Hopes are blooming in autumn cold,
		My horse wanders, like a quiet fate,
		And catches the edge of the waving clothes
		His slightly wet brown lip .

		On a long journey, not to battle, not to rest,
		Invisible traces attract me,
		The day will go out, flashing the fifth gold,
		And in the box of years the works will settle down.

		*

		Loose rust blush on the road
		Bald hills and clotted sand,
		And the dusk dances in the halo of whose anxiety,
		Bending the moon into a shepherd's horn.

		Milky smoke shakes the wind of the village,
		But there is no wind, there is only a slight ringing.
		And Rus' slumbers in its merry anguish,
		Clutching your hands in the yellow steep slope.

		*

		Beckons overnight, not far from the hut,
		of sluggish dill .
		On the beds of gray wavy cabbage
		The horn of the moon pours oil drop by drop.

		I reach for the warmth, I breathe in the softness of the bread
		And with a fragility I mentally bite cucumbers,
		Behind the smooth surface of the shuddering sky
		Brings the cloud out of the stall by the bridle.

		*

		Overnight , overnight, I have long been familiar
		Your passing fuzziness in the blood,
		The hostess is sleeping, and the fresh straw
		Crushed by the thighs of widowed love.

		It's already dawning, cockroach paint
		The deity is circled in the corner,
		But a fine rain with his early prayer
		Still knocking on the muddy glass.

		*

		Again in front of me is a blue field,
		The puddles of the sun sway the ruddy face.
		Others in the heart of joy and pain,
		And a new dialect sticks to the tongue.

		Unsteady water freezes the blue in the eyes,
		My horse wanders, throwing back the bit,
		And a handful of swarthy foliage after a day's heap
		Throws the wind after from the hem.

		1916


* * *

		Hewn drogs sang,
		Plains and bushes run.
		Again chapels on the road
		And memorial crosses.

		Again I am sick with warm sadness
		From the oatmeal breeze.
		And on the lime of the bell towers
		Involuntarily, a hand crosses.

		O Rus' - raspberry field
		And the blue that fell into the river -
		I love to joy and pain
		Your lake longing.

		Cold grief cannot be measured,
		You are on a foggy shore.
		But not to love you, not to believe -
		I can't learn.

		And I will not give these chains
		And I will not part with a long sleep,
		When native steppes ring
		Prayer feather grass.

		1916


* * *

		Fluffy ringing and swearing,
		And a stone under the cross.
		An evil blizzard is lashing
		A cracked whip.

		Shaman forest magician
		About black fate.
		You are lying, my peer ,
		In an unhewn coffin.

		Let the Finnish knife again
		Bleeding his blade
		Won't bother you
		Not a walker, not a rider.

		And only from the forests
		Through the cloud cover
		The moon will shed a tear
		On my wilted corpse.

		1916-1917


* * *

		About comrades in the forest,
		About silvered fields
		Saddened like a dove
		The joy of solitary years.

		Catches memory with a thin beak
		First snow and first trip.
		In the sled of the lake over the meadow
		The belated call of ducks.

		Under the window from slippery firs
		Shadow holds out his hands.
		T their waters paragush kvely
		Smokes a cradle at the bend.

		Light smoke and distant harvest
		Sends a bow to the day of caresses and cherries.
		The smell of herbs from the woman's skin
		On my lips I hear.

		Peace be with you, groves, meadows and lindens,
		Lithium honey incense!
		All accepted with a smile
		Nothing is needed from you.

		1916


* * *

		Spring is not like joy,
		And the sand is not yellow from the sun.
		Your weathered skin
		Luchila buckwheat fluff.

		At the blue waterhole
		On the pine swan
		We swore we'd be two
		And we will not part anywhere.

		I censed , and the evening is skinny
		Twisted in a fiery carving,
		I walked you to the grove
		To your parent's hut.

		And for a long, long time in a shaky slumber
		I couldn't take my face off
		When you with a gentle smile
		He waved his hat to me from the porch.

		1916


* * *

		has not yet dried up -
		Green water in the grass!
		Abandoned arable lands yearn,
		And wilt, quinoa wilt.

		I wander through the streets and puddles,
		Autumn day is shy and wild.
		And in every husband I meet
		I want to comprehend your sweet face.

		You are more mysterious and more beautiful
		You look at the vague edges.
		Oh, for you only our happiness
		And my true friendship.

		And if death by God's will
		Sweeps your eyes with his hand,
		I swear that a shadow in an open field
		I will follow death and you.

		1916

In memory of Misha Murashev

		Today chenille puddles
		And a gentle breeze whispered.
		Know no one needs
		The sky is green sand.

		We lived and were in reality,
		Everywhere everywhere alone.
		You, like spring through the oak forest,
		You drink your white days.

		You love, you love, I know
		Gentle souls to caress
		But won't let us go to heaven
		Our earthly seal.

		Eternal distance before us
		Our path is thoughtful and simple.
		Will give us shelter behind the hills
		Graveyard covered with dirt.

		March 15, 1916


* * *

		The red wings of the sunset are fading,
		Wattle fences doze quietly in the fog.
		Do not grieve, my white hut,
		That again we are about days and alone.

		Cleans the moon in the thatched roof
		Horns rimmed with blue.
		I did not follow her and did not go out
		Escort behind deaf haystacks.

		I know the years will drown out the anxiety.
		This pain, like years, will pass.
		And the mouth, and the innocent soul
		She saves for others.

		is not strong,
		Only the proud live in strength.
		And the other will crumble and abandon,
		Like a collar corroded by raw materials.
		I'm not waiting for fate out of melancholy,
		It will viciously twist the powder&#225;.
		And she will come to our land
		Warm up your baby.
		He will take off his fur coat and untie his shawls,
		Come with me by the fire...
		And calmly and kindly say
		That the child is like me.
		1916


BEGGER WITH PARIS

		Eyes like faded burdock
		Coins in hand.
		Once a glorious shepherd
		Now he sings about many summers.
		And there is an old woman from the corner,
		That sheds tears in front of the icon,
		She was his love
		And drunken juice in the middle of the green.
		There is dry dust on the scrolls of years.
		The past is not in the dawn of the kukan.
		And only a gnawed crutch
		In his hands it rings like before.
		She is a stranger to him now
		I forgot the voiced pity.
		And how will it go, hurrying, out the door,
		Give him a penny in the palm of his hand.
		He won't look her in the eye
		At a meeting, the eyes will become more painful,
		But, baptized on the image,
		The slave will be remembered by name.

		1916


* * *

		Farewell, dear forest,
		Sorry, golden spring.
		Clouds float and break
		O solar coulter.

		Shine on, good day
		And I want to be sad.
		Knife behind the boot
		I don't wear anymore.

		Under the belly of a foal
		In the dead of night do not sleep
		And ringing with joy
		Lesov not to announce.

		And do not avoid bending the storm,
		Don't miss the loss
		To ring out in the blue
		Ring of invisible gates.

		1916


* * *

		Blushed rowan,
		Blue water.
		Moon, sad rider,
		Dropped the occasion.

		Came out of the grove again
		Darkness blue swan.
		miraculous relics
		He brought on wings.

		You are the land, my land, dear,
		Eternal plowman and howl,
		Like Volga under a willow
		You bowed your head.

		Get up, healing has come
		The Savior visited you.
		swan song
		Undead rainbow eyes.

		Sunset sacrifice
		Atone for all sin.
		New freshness of the wind
		The smell of ripe snow.

		But invisible yeast
		Everything is warmer and warmer ...
		I will remember you in the rain
		I am Yesenin Sergey.

		1916


* * *

		Your voice is invisible, like smoke in a hut.
		With a humble heart I pray to you.

		I feed the spirit with oat face,
		Helper of life and quiet friend.

		Light is sown by the ore of the sun,
		There is no name for eternal truth.

		Time counts the sand of dreams
		But you added new grains.

		Words grow in invisible fields,
		The feather-grass mixed with the thought.

		On strong folds of upraised hands
		Erects the church builder sound.

		There is joy in the souls - to trample your color,
		On the first snow to see your trace.

		But more beautiful meekness and subdued ardor
		Bowed eyelids before the sound of wings.

		1916


* * *

		Where the secret always slumbers
		There are other fields.
		only a guest, a random guest
		On your mountains, earth.

		Wide forests and waters,
		Strong flutter of air wings.
		But your centuries and years
		Clouded the run of the luminaries.

		I'm not kissed by you
		My fate is not connected with you.
		A new path has been prepared for me
		From going east.

		I was originally destined
		Fly into the silent darkness.
		Nothing at the hour of farewell
		I won't leave it to anyone.

		But for your world, from the starry heights,
		In the peace where the storm sleeps
		In two moons I will light over the abyss
		Irresistible eyes.

		1916


* * *

		Clouds from the foal
		I laugh like a hundred mares.
		Splashing over me
		Flames of red wings.

		The sky is like an udder
		Stars are like nipples.
		God's name swells
		In the belly of a sheep.

		I believe tomorrow is early
		A little light shines
		new under the fog
		Nazareth will rise.

		The new will be glorified
		Christmas fields ,
		And like a dog it barks
		Dawn behind the mountain.

		I just know it will
		Terrible scream and cry
		People will renounce
		Praise the new face.

		The rattle of damask steel
		Rip up the mouth of the earth...
		And from the cheeks of sunset
		Cheekbones-days will jump off.

		Run like deer
		To the steppe of other sides,
		Where he raises his hands
		New Simeon.

		1916


* * *

		Fires burn across the river
		Moss and stumps burn.
		Oh, bathed, oh, bathed,
		Moss and stumps burn.

		The goblin is crying at the pine -
		Pity the summer spring.
		Oh, bathed, oh, bathed,
		Pity the summer spring.

		And our x at the gate
		The girls are dancing.
		Oh, bathed, oh, bathed,
		The girls are dancing.

		Who is joy, who is sin,
		And we are happy, and we are laughing.
		Oh, bathed, oh, bathed,
		And we are happy, and we are laughing.

		1916


* * *

		The stars were stingy in an invisible nonsense,
		Zhu tko and terribly awakened nonsense.
		I am drunkenly circling in a rumpled grove,
		I want to crush the stars with my hand.
		The psaltery of a merry tone gleams,
		Frets are washed in the foamy lake.
		Breasts are elastic, like juicy blows,
		She fawns on whirlwinds so that they blow into her bones.
		It melts, like a happy ug, the dawn of vespers,
		Vespers with quiet joy in the heart.

		1916


* * *

		You didn't believe in my God
		Russia, my homeland!
		You, like a witch, gave a measure,
		And I was like your stepson.
		The fighter forgot the bold courage,
		The prophet became senile and became blind.
		Oh, give me a cold hand -
		Walk along the same path.
		Let's go, let's go, sleepy princess,
		To a cheerful faith and one,
		Where joy shines from time immemorial
		Burning bush.
		Don't bend your head on your mighty chest
		And do not be afraid of a prophetic dream.
		Oh, be my mother
		In my fatal fall.

		1916


* * *

		The yarn of snowy flax spun,
		A requiem whirlwind is crying at the window.
		The road was covered with a blizzard sleeve,
		We live our whole life with this memorial service.
		Sing and weep, winds, on the path,
		There is nothing for us to pay the priest in remembrance.
		Listen to my heart poor man
		We will never hear sadness beyond the grave.
		How we die - without singing, under the wind chime
		They will carry us to the church for the secular canon.
		No one to cry, no one to incense,
		Do they have a desire to come for free.
		Only the wind is frisky, such a mischievous one,
		Sing separation instead of rest.

		1916


* * *

		It's not the clouds that roam behind the barn
		And not cold.
		The mother of God kneaded her son
		Kolob.

		Every drug she watered the zhito
		In oil.
		Baked and laid quietly
		In a manger.

		The baby played in joy,
		Fell into slumber
		He dropped the gilded kolob
		On straw.

		Kolob rolled over the gate
		Rye.
		Tears clouded the blue soul
		God's.

		Mother of God spoke to her son
		Advi?e:
		"Don't cry, my swan,
		Don't complain.

		On earth all people are human,
		Chad .
		At least one little fun for them
		Necessary.

		It's terrible for them between the dark
		Perelesits,
		I called this colob -
		Month".

		1916


* * *

		I danced, wept the spring rain,
		The storm has died down.
		I'm bored with you, Sergei Yesenin,
		Raise your eyes...

		It's boring to listen under the heavenly tree
		Wave of invisible wings:
		You won't wake up with your melody
		Grandfather's graves!

		Tied, reined in the word
		Far from your times.
		Not in the winds, but, to know, in heavy volumes
		Your dream will ring.

		Someone will sit down, someone will arch their shoulders,
		Pulls out the feathers.
		Your red evening is close to someone,
		Don't need you.

		He will stir up Bryusov and Blok,
		Will disturb others.
		But still the day will rise from the east,
		Just like that, a moment will flash.

		Melodies will not change the face of the earth,
		Do not shake off the sheet ...
		Forever your nailed to the tree
		Red mouth.

		Forever outstretched deaf hands
		Your starry Pilate.
		Or, Or, lama savakhfani,
		Let go into the sunset.

		1916 - 1917




Poems of 1917



* * *

		Under the red elm porch and yard,
		The moon above the roof is like a golden hillock.

		A face is dripped on the blue windows:
		A gray-haired old man wanders through the cloud.

		He is a swarthy handful among the quiet trees
		Throws stars - winter sowing.

		A field grows, and grains of souls
		With the sound of the sky they fall into the wilderness.

		I remember the time, it's like a sound
		It pounded with its beak into the branch of the tree.

		I was in the cereal, but the bone mind
		Already believed in the field and water noise.

		In the boundary under the spruce, where the cloud-tyn,
		I dreamed of rivers of golden valleys.

		And my spirit heard about the edge of the hills,
		Where there is birth in the sowing of words.

		O muse, my flexible friend,
		My jealous.
		Again under the rain, loose
		We took to the fields.

		Again spring rumble
		Dol greets us
		Baby wrapped
		Dawn the moon in the hem.

		Now would the song of the wind
		And gentle bayu -
		For making you strong
		Because the holiday is bright
		And you poured into my chest.

		Now to splash into the sky
		Cherry juice verse
		For fatherly generosity
		your mentors.

		O honey of memories!
		O ringing of distant lindens!
		Sang to us like a star in the fog
		Razumnikov face.

		Then in the merry noise
		Playful thoughts and forces
		Apo table gentle Klyuev
		He carried us in his arms.

		Now we are mature
		And heavier...
		But will not drown out the trill
		That nightingale holiday.

		And this rain is crazy
		It won't wash away in us
		So that the ringing of your lamp
		Under the wind did not go out.

		Snow, words but spongy honey,
		He lay down under a straight palisade.
		Licking calf humpbacked
		Evening red hem.

		Quiet. From the bread spirit
		Someone is dreaming of April.
		The old woman coughs
		Chest leaning on the tow.

		Red-haired granddaughter
		Feels the pages in the book.
		camp is flexible and thin,
		Hands are whiter than birch bark.

		Grandma got lucky
		Only one thing is missing:
		Poor problem solving
		Mind drunk by the wind.

		From the eye, from the unkind look
		She's often underwhelmed
		Drink it with a slander
		Prepolovno water.

		And for deaf bows
		From the face of fallen gray hairs
		Writes them numbers from the icon
		God's servant is Damascene.

		1917


* * *

		silver bell,
		You sing? Does the heart dream?
		Light from pink icon
		On my golden eyelashes.

		Let not I be that gentle boy
		In the splash of dove wings,
		My dream is joyful and meek
		About an unearthly copse.

		I don't need the sigh of the grave
		A word with a secret cannot be embraced.
		Learn to be able
		Never wake up.

		1917


* * *

		To the warm light, on the father's threshold,
		sigh pulls me .

		Grandma and grandfather are waiting on the porch
		Frisky grandson of sunflower years.

		Slender and white, like a birch, their grandson,
		With honey hair and velvet hands.

		Only, oh friend, in blue eyes -
		His life in the world dreamed of them.

		Sends them radiant joy in the darkness
		The bright maiden in the icon corner.

		With a quiet smile on thin lips
		She holds their grandson in her arms.

		1917


* * *

		There is a bright joy under the canopy of the bushes
		Cry about the past of native shores
		And, caressing the first gray hair on the forehead,
		With pleasant pain, blame fate.
		No friend, no thought of woman's lips
		Does not mature in her quiet-wise words,
		But there is in it, like faith, a living dream
		Bring your lips closer to the invisible light.
		We love the evening in it, oats over the river, -
		And youths of frisky hair with copper.
		Shaking ghostly smoke from your eyebrows,
		It is sweet for us to tell them secrets.
		There is tender meekness, sitting on the threshold,
		Pray for the sunset and the face of the roads.
		In sprinkled groves, in compressed fields
		Our thought about teenage days is sad.
		Behind the father's fairy tale, behind the sound of rafters
		carries the rustle of unknown wings ...
		But firmly in the plains of feather grass meadows
		The truth of parental dreams rests.
		1917


* * *

		Oh Rus', flap your wings,
		Put another support!
		With other names
		Another steppe rises.

		Through the blue valley
		Between heifers and cows
		Walks in a golden row
		Your Alexey Koltsov.

		In the hands - a loaf of bread,
		Mouth - cherry juice.
		And starred the sky
		Shepherd's horn.

		Behind him, from snow and wind,
		From the monastery gates
		Walks dressed in light
		His middle brother.

		From Vytegra to Shuya
		He hut razed the whole region
		And he chose the nickname - Klyuev,
		Humble Nicholas.

		The monks are wise and kind,
		He is all in the carving of rumors,
		And quietly descends Easter
		With a headless head.

		And there, beyond the tarry hill,
		I go, the path is melting,
		Curly and cheerful
		I'm such a robber.

		Long , steep road
		Mountain slopes are innumerable;
		But even with the mystery of God
		I am secretly arguing.

		I knock down the month with a stone
		And on dumb shivers
		I throw, hanging into the sky,
		Knife from the shaft.

		Behind me an invisible swarm
		There is a ring of others
		And far from the villages
		Their belligerent verse rings .

		From herbs we knit books,
		We shake words from two floors.
		And our relative, Chapygin,
		Melodious, like snow and dol.

		Hide, perish, you tribe
		Festering dreams and thoughts!
		On a stone top
		We carry stellar noise.

		Enough to rot and whine,
		And glorify vzlo that vile -
		Already washed away, erased the tar
		Resurrected Rus'.

		Already moved the wings
		Her dumb support!
		With other names
		Another steppe rises.

		1917


* * *

		Dawn over the field - like a red tyn.
		The eternal son floats on a cloud.

		The grandmother came out to feed the chickens .
		The holy salary burns in heaven.

		- Hello, granddaughter!
		- Hello, world!
		- Go to the hut.
		- Is grandpa at home?

		- He fixes a net to catch ruffs.
		- How many days does a grandfather have?

		- Already soon nine dozen winters.-
		And the granddaughters fluttered like white smoke.

		With the soul of his grandfather, he swam into the fog,
		Where noon ripens invisible countries.

		1917


* * *

		Is the sky so white
		Or water faded with salt?
		You sing and the song is frantic
		Bregovye knits occasions.

		Blue millstone scattered and ground
		Water grains for flour.
		blue space and gold
		Girded your longing.

		Not alarmed by the gloomy caress
		Tanned wave of your hand.
		It doesn't matter - Arkhangelsk or Umboy
		Swim to the Solovki.

		All the same, under the worn deck
		You see a hunched up skete.
		sings to you
		About the bends of the local willows.

		I just want to hang out to the song
		Above the water, pushing the day ...
		But quietly shines instead of a month
		A seal reflected on a cloud.

		1917


* * *

		The mountain ash is not trembling from the cold,
		The blue sea boils not from the wind.

		They watered the earth with the joy of snow,
		Grandfather dreams of Jordanian shores.

		He sees lakes and bushes in the valleys,
		Bridges span the lakes.

		Like on a bridge, curly and yellow-haired,
		Wandering lad, the son of Joseph, Jesus.

		From sunrise to sunset in the gloomy waters
		He calls the ducks and he calls the fishes:

		"You come to me, creatures, for the stern,
		Teach me wisdom."

		As along the bank, between the hollows and mountains,
		Quietly flows their conversation-conversation.

		Small fish, splashing on the sand,
		Does it give its underwater voice:

		"You, child, dear child, Christ,
		We have come to you with a bow for interrogation.

		You go study in the deserts and forests;
		Our secret is reflected in the sky."

		1917


THE MISSING MONTH

		Cloud like a mouse
		ran up and waved
		In the sky with a huge tail.
		Like an egg
		splintered, slipped
		Moon beyond the distant hill.

		The sun in the morning in the well of lakes
		Looked -
		no month...
		It hung its legs on a hillock,
		Clicked -
		no month.

		That cry was heard from the river by a fisherman,
		The old man decided to play a joke.
		Reflection from the sun
		from morning water
		He began to catch with his hands.

		Fished out.
		Twisted the twine tightly,
		Ears kneeled.
		Got out and quietly on a golden beam
		solar age
		tied.

		The sun raised its eyes to the sky
		And said:
		"My work is hard!"
		And suddenly the sun
		something brought the eyelids together
		Ogle sank -
		a month here.

		Like a squirrel on a branch, in the sun in the eyes
		Joy surged...
		But suddenly...

		The beam broke
		and over slippery hills
		Reflection rolled into the meadow.

		The sun is scared...
		And the old grandfather
		Laughing, roared like thunder.
		And a dove with him
		Evening light
		Waving his wing in his mouth.

		1917


* * *

		Night and the field, and the cry of roosters ...
		Sabaoth looks from the golden cloud.
		Biting wind in plain blue
		Rolls apples from skinny aspens.

		Here it is, sad ripple
		With a crane longing for September!
		Silent bell over the pond
		Father's house overturned.

		Here everything is the same as it was then,
		The same rivers and the same herds.
		Only willows above the red mound
		The shabby hem is shaken.

		Someone is folded, someone has sunk into darkness,
		No one can sing on the hill.
		Peacefully dreams of the birthplace
		About the shoulders that died in the darkness.

		Quiet, quiet in the divine corner,
		A month kneads kutya on the floor ...
		But disturbing only the mention of silence
		A shy mouse from the oven.

		1917


* * *

		O land of rain and bad weather,
		wandering silence,
		Carpet of bread under the holy
		Your moon is broken.

		Behind the plowed field
		Crimson swan.
		On a cloud branch, like a plum,
		A ripe star shines.

		Again dear milestone,
		In spite of your misfortune
		Delirium and smell spring
		On blue water.

		Swamp smoke swirls and dances ...
		But even in a cloak of melodious darkness
		Inexpressible animal
		Your hills are drunk.

		1917


* * *

		silver bell,
		You sing? Does the heart dream?
		Light from pink icon
		On my golden eyelashes.

		Let not I be that gentle boy
		In the splash of dove wings,
		My dream is joyful and meek
		About an unearthly copse.

		I don't need the sigh of the grave
		A word with a secret cannot be embraced.
		Learn to be able
		Never wake up.

		1917


* * *

		The winds did not blow in vain,
		The storm was not in vain.
		Someone secret by a quiet light
		Drunk my eyes.

		With someone's affectionate spring
		I was sad in the blue haze
		About the beautiful, but unearthly,
		Undiscovered land.

		Silent milkiness does not oppress
		Star fear does not disturb.
		I loved the world and eternity
		As a parental eye Mr.

		Everything in them is blessed and holy,
		Everything disturbing is light.
		Splashing red poppy sunset
		On lake glass.

		And involuntarily in a sea of bread
		The image is torn from the tongue:
		Hoteled sky
		Licks a red heifer.

		1917


* * *

		Snowstorm sweeps
		white path,
		Wants in soft snows
		Drown.

		The wind fell asleep
		On a way;
		Don't drive through the forest
		Neither pass.

		A carol ran
		to the village,
		I took white in my hands
		Pomelo.

		Gay you, non-human people,
		People,
		Get out of the way
		Forward!

		The blizzard got scared
		On the snows
		I ran quickly
		To the meadows.

		The wind is also awake
		jumped up
		Yes, and a hat with curls
		Dropped.

		In the morning the raven to the birch
		Knock...
		And hung up that hat
		On the bough.

		1917


* * *

		The wind whistles under the steep fence,
		Hiding in the grass.
		I know that a drunkard and a thief
		I will live my life.
		The day is sinking behind the red hills,
		Calls to the boundary.
		I'm not alone in this world,
		I am not wandering alone.
		The field of Russian arable lands swung,
		Either grass or snow.
		It doesn't matter whether I'm a Litvin or a Chuvash,
		My cross is like everyone else's.
		I believe, like miraculous faces,
		In my secret hour
		He will come as a vagabond under the fence,
		Indestructible Savior.
		But maybe in the blue wisps of smoke
		secret rivers
		I will pass it with a drunken smile,
		Never knowing.
		A tear does not shine in my eyelashes,
		Do not scare away the dream.
		Only joy blue dove
		Drift into darkness.
		And again, as before, with wild anger
		Longing sings...
		Let at least the wind on my graveyard
		Trepaka is dancing.

		1917


O HOMELAND!

		Oh homeland, oh new
		With a golden roof of blood,
		Trumpet, moo like a cow,
		Roar telkom thunders.

		I wander through the blue villages,
		Such a blessing.
		Desperate, cheerful
		But I am all in you, mother.

		In the school of revelry
		I strengthened the flesh and mind.
		From the birch rumble
		Your noise is growing.

		I love your vices
		And drunkenness, and robbery,
		And in the morning in the east
		Lose yourself as a star.

		And all of you, as I know
		I want to crush and take
		And I curse bitterly
		Because you are my mother.

		1917


* * *

		Where the secret always slumbers
		There are other fields.
		I am only a guest, a random guest
		On your mountains, earth.

		Wide forests and waters,
		Strong flutter of air wings.
		But your centuries and years
		Clouded the run of the luminaries.

		I'm not kissed by you
		My fate is not connected with you.
		A new path has been prepared for me
		From going east.

		I was originally destined
		Fly into the silent darkness.
		Nothing at the hour of farewell
		I won't leave it to anyone.

		But for your world, from the starry heights,
		In the peace where the storm sleeps
		In two moons I will light over the abyss
		Irresistible eyes.

		1917


* * *

		Where are you, where are you, father's house,
		Warming his back under the hillock?
		Blue, blue is my flower
		Rough sand.
		Where are you, where are you, father's house?

		A rooster crows across the river.
		There was a shepherd guarding the flocks,
		And glowed from the water
		Three distant stars.
		A rooster crows across the river.

		Time is a windmill with a wing
		Drops behind the village
		Month pendulum in rye
		Pour hours of invisible rain.
		Time is a windmill with a wing.

		This rain with a host of arrows
		In the clouds my house spun,
		Blue knocked down a flower,
		Golden crushed sand.
		This rain with a host of arrows.

		Songs, songs, what are you screaming about?
		Do you have nothing more to give?
		Blue dormant thread
		I'm learning to weave into my curls.

		I want to be quiet and strict.
		I am learning from the star in silence.
		Good willow on the road
		Watch over dormant Rus'.

		Good in this moonlit autumn
		Wander the grass alone
		And gather ears of corn on the road
		In an impoverished soul-bag.

		But plain blue does not heal.
		Songs, songs, or not to shake you off? ..
		Golden panicle evening
		Clears my smooth path.

		And so joyful to me over the forest
		Shouting in the wind:
		"Be cold en you living,
		Like autumn gold limes.

		Oh Rus', flap your wings,
		Put another support!
		With other names

		Between heifers and cows
		Walks in a golden row

		In the hands - the edge of ha bread,
		Mouth - cherry juice.
		And starred the sky

		I look into the field, I look into the sky -
		Paradise in the fields and in the sky.
		Drowning again in heaps of bread
		My unplowed land.

		Again in the unpasted groves
		inescapable herds,
		And flows from the green mountains
		Golden water.

		Oh, I believe - to know, for the torment
		Over the lost man
		Someone caressing hands
		Spills milk.

		Wake me up early tomorrow
		O my patient mother!
		I'll go for the road mound

		Today I saw in the forest
		Trail of wide wheels in the meadow.
		The wind blows under the cloud
		His golden arc.

		At dawn he will rush tomorrow,
		Hat-moon bent under a bush,
		And the mare will playfully wave
		Above the plain with a red tail .

		Wake me up early tomorrow
		Shine a light in our upper room.
		They say that I will soon be
		Famous Russian poet.

		I will sing for you and the guest,
		Our stove, rooster and blood ...
		And it will spill on my songs
		The milk of your red cows.

		You are good, O white surface!
		A light frost warms my blood!
		So I want to press to the body

COMRADE

		He was the son of a simple worker,
		And his story is very short.
		The only thing in him was that his hair was like night
		Yes, blue eyes, meek.
		father from morning to evening
		He bent his back to feed the baby;
		But he had nothing to do
		And he had comrades: Christ and a cat.
		The cat was old, deaf,
		Didn't hear mice or flies
		And Christ was sitting in the arms of his mother
		And he looked from the icon at the kill under the roof.
		Martin lived, and no one knew about him.
		The days pounded sadly like rain on iron.
		And only sometimes at a meager dinner
		His father taught him to sing the Marseillaise.
		"Grow up," he said, "you will understand ...
		Guess why we are so poor!"
		And his chipped knife trembled in his ear
		Over the stale hump of daily food.
		But under the board
		window -
		Two winds waved
		Wing;
		That with spring fire
		waters
		Russian
		People...
		Shafts roar
		Thunderstorm sings!
		From the blue haze
		Burning eyes.
		For a wave of a wave,
		Above the corpse is a corpse;
		Breaks fear
		Your strong tooth.
		All takeoff and takeoff
		All scream and scream!
		Into the bottomless mouth
		Spring is running...
		And then someone struck
		The last sad hour..
		But believe me, he didn't get shy
		Before the power of the enemy's eyes!
		His soul oh , as before,
		Fearless and strong
		And reaching out for hope
		Bloodless hand.
		He lived in vain
		No wonder he crushed flowers;
		But not like you
		Faded dreams...
		Accidentally, unexpectedly
		From the native porch
		Got to Martin
		Father's last cry.
		With sweaty eyes,
		With shy blue lips
		He fell to his knees
		Embracing the cold corpse.
		But he raised his eyebrows
		I rubbed my eyes with my hand,
		Ran back to the house
		And became under the image.
		"Jesus, Jesus, do you hear?
		You see? I am alone.
		Calling you and calling
		Comrade your Martin!
		Father lies dead
		But he did not fall like a coward.
		I hear him calling us
		O my faithful Jesus.
		He calls us for help
		Where the Russian people fight
		Commands to stand for the will,
		For equality and labor!.."
		And kindly accepting
		The sound of innocent speeches
		came down to earth
		From unwavering hands.
		They go hand in hand
		And the night is black, black!..
		And puffed up misfortune
		Silence.
		Dreams bloom with hope
		About eternal, free rock.
		Both undead forever
		February wind.
		But suddenly the lights flashed...
		cargo barked .
		And fell, struck by a bullet,
		Baby Jesus.
		Listen:
		No more Sunday!
		His body was buried
		He lies
		On Mars
		Field.
		And where the mother remained,
		Where should he not be
		Bole,
		Sits by the window
		old cat,
		Catching the moon with its paw ...
		Martin crawls on the floor:
		"You are my falcons, falcons,
		You are in captivity
		In captivity!"
		His voice is getting fainter, fainter,
		Someone is crushing him, someone is choking him,
		Burning with fire.
		But quietly ringing
		Outside the window,
		Turning off, then flaring up
		Again,
		Iron
		Word:
		"R re-es-puu-public!"

SINGING CALL

		Rejoice!
		The earth appeared

		Spread across the seas!
		Our northern miracle
		Do not comprehend your sons!
		Do not know you Tabor,
		Do not hear the secret call!
		blurred vision
		Cover on your lips.
		Everything is stubborn, everything is in vain
		Your mouth catches the darkness.
		No, you won't give the truth in the manger
		Yours to tell Christ!
		But know
		Sleeping deep:
		She lit up
		Star Vostok!
		Don't repay it to Herod
		The blood of babies...
		"Dance, Salome, dance!"
		Your legs are light and winged.
		Kiss you lips without a soul, -
		But your hour of reckoning is near!
		John is already up
		exhausted from wounds,
		Picked up from the ground
		severed head,
		And they roar again
		His mouth
		They threaten again
		Sodom:
		"Remember!"
		People, my brothers people,
		Where are you? Respond!
		I don't need you, fearless
		Bloodthirsty knight.
		I don't want you to win
		I don't need tribute!
		We are all apple trees and cherries
		Blue garden.
		We are all grapes
		golden summer,
		Enough for all of us until death
		And heat and light!
		Someone wise, unspeakable,
		All like yourself
		He warms all living with a song,
		The dead - sleep in a coffin.
		Someone teaches us and asks
		Recognize and measure.
		Do not destroy came and we are in the world,
		And love and believe!

		Clouds are like lakes
		The moon is a red goose.
		Dancing in front of your eyes
		Violent Rus'.
		The green forest trembled,
		The spring boiled.
		hello updated.
		Reach out, man!
		Blue waters -
		Your peace and light
		Of disastrous freedom
		Not in this world.
		Sing, call and demand
		Hidden shores;
		Won't fall from the sky
		Star arc!
		Will not drop the evening
		Red bucket;
		Mighty Shoulders -
		What is a granite mountain.

		Under the cloud tree
		top m on the moon
		February snowstorm
		You roar in me.
		heavenly daughters
		The flint is curled;
		taught you faith
		Gray fireman.
		He gave you a pike
		Thunder Yatag
		And the power of Anika
		Marked your step.
		Dawn - like a wolf
		With a grinned mouth;
		But you drive dashing about
		Double cross.
		Will you reach out your hand
		Or bow your face,
		You give her the edge
		On yellow tongue.
		And the beast feels
		Under the rainbow of words:
		diamond doors
		And star cover.

		O miracle worker!
		Broad-cheeked and red-mouthed,
		Received in corruzly hands
		tender baby,
		rock my soul
		On your toes!
		I am your son
		Growing up like a willow
		On the road
		Learned to look at you
		Like a lake.
		You are ineffable and wise.
		By your gray hairs
		I know it was snow
		On the fields
		And I'll eat.
		In blue eyes
		I glorify
		Red
		Summer.

		Oh, it's spring today
		You jumped like a stream!
		The shuttle strokes the waves,
		And silence sings.
		Volkhov ringing is heard
		And Buslaev revelry,
		Became friends under the rumble
		Volga, Caspian and Don.
		Blue-lipped Ural
		Exposes fangs,
		But the Solovki are incense
		In his blue grin.
		You invite everyone to a feast,
		Warm cry, like a candle,
		Pressing on your shoulder
		Unkissed world.
		Holy and peaceful is your gift,
		Blue and song in speeches,
		And burns on the shoulders
		Irresistible ball!

		Throw it in the sky
		Put it on poles!
		There moon bread
		Sheaves are golden.
		There's hunger and thirst
		Roots do not sing
		But one ripens
		Light of angelic yurts.
		There with the call of the dish
		The coolness of the bush
		And red Judas
		Kiss Christ.
		But the sound of a kiss
		Money does not rattle
		And the Akatui chain -
		Path in front of the skete.
		There is a decrepit time
		Wandering through the meadows
		All Russian tribe
		Calls to tables.
		And, glorifying courage
		And your proud spirit
		Sychenoy Braga
		Circles them.

With my voice I will devour Thee, Lord.

C.O.

		O motherland , happy
		And a non-starting hour!
		No better, no prettier
		Your cow eyes.
		You, your fogs
		And sheep in the fields
		I carry like a sheaf of oatmeal,
		I am the sun in my arms.
		Holy midnight
		And merry christmas
		So that those who are thirsty for vigil
		drunk .
		We shake the sky with our shoulders,
		We shake the darkness with our hands
		And in a skinny ear of bread
		We inhale star grass.
		Oh Rus', oh steppe and winds,
		And you, my father's house!
		On the golden line
		Spring thunder is nesting.
		With oats we feed the storm
		We will drink the valley with prayer,
		And blue arable land
		We plow the mind-ox.
		And not a single stone
		Through sling and bow,
		Won't beat us
		Lifting up God's hands.

		2

		"Oh girl
		Maria! -
		Heaven sings. -
		On the fields of gold
		Shed your hair.
		Wash our faces
		The hand of the earth.
		With a string behind the mountains
		The ships are sailing.
		They contain the souls of the dead
		And the memory of the ages.
		Oh, woe, who grumbles,
		Without removing the shackles!
		Screaming in the dark
		And beating forehead
		Under secret signs
		We will not close the gates.
		But bend over who's out
		And I saw only a moment!
		We are the cloud roof
		Let's crush the blind."

		3

		Oh god, god
		Are you
		Are you rocking the ground in your dreams?
		Constellations shining dust
		On our hair.
		Noisy heavenly cedar
		Through fog and moat
		And to the valley of troubles
		The cones of words are falling.
		They sing about the days
		Other lands and waters
		Where on tight branches
		Biting their lunar mouth.
		And whisper about the bushes
		impenetrable groves,
		Where he dances, having removed the ports,
		Golden rain.

		4

		Hosanna in the highest!
		The hills sing about paradise.
		And in that paradise I see
		You, my fatherland.
		Under the Mauritian oak
		My red-haired grandfather is sitting,
		And his fur coat shines
		Peas of frequent stars.
		And that cat hat
		What did he wear on holiday?
		Looks like a month, chilly
		On the snow of native graves.
		From the hills I shout to my grandfather:
		"O father, respond..."
		But the cedars doze quietly,
		Hanging the branches down.
		The voice does not reach
		To his distant shore...
		But chu! Ringing like an ear
		Snow growing from the ground
		"Arise, see and see!
		Unspeakable rock.
		Who lives and builds everything -
		He knows the hour and the time.
		God's cliques will sound
		Fire and storm pipes,
		And a yellow-fanged cloud
		Will bite the milky navel.
		And the womb will come out
		Burn the reins...
		But the one who thought of a virgin,
		He will enter the ship of the star.

COMING

A. Bely

		1

		Lord, I believe!
		But let me into your paradise
		Rain arrows
		My pierced edge.
		Behind the untrodden mountain
		In the blue of the valleys
		Me again, oh my god
		Your son appears.
		I pray for you
		From men's places;
		From the awakened Russia
		He carries his cross.
		But before the secret of the island
		Beginningless words
		There are no apostles behind him,
		There are no students.

		2

		Oh Rus', ever-virgin,
		have corrected death!
		From the starry womb
		You went down to the firmament.
		On the sheep manger
		Osynila dol
		For what is in the forerunners
		There was a plowman and an ox.
		Look at the fields
		On compressed oats, -
		Under the snowy willow
		Your Christ has fallen!
		Again his war
		whipping
		And they beat with tin
		Oh ledges of darkness...

		3

		But to the whirlwind of the abyss
		He is mute and deaf.
		From the pole of the constellation
		The rooster crows.
		O others, where are you?
		The deadline is near.
		You are dark, womb
		And the cross is high.
		Here is the mountain warrior
		Feel the darkness.
		Christ the Guardian
		Sits in the corner.
		"I saw: with him he
		We have been sowed darkness!
		"No, I'm not Simon...
		Simple fisherman.
		The mold sighed
		And the snow is gone...
		That third song
		The rooster crowed.

		4

		Hey lord
		My king!
		Devils in your arms
		Rocked the earth.
		Again his coming
		The cross is raised.
		is torn apart again .
		Silence of fields and mind
		Sharpens spears.
		Stairway to your garden
		No seizures.
		How will I ascend, how will I climb it
		With blood on fathers and brothers?
		The earth is pulling me
		The sands were sealed off.
		On your rivers
		Dry.

		5

		Simone, Peter...
		Where are you? Come on.
		Willows shuddered:
		"There, ahead!"
		Simone, Peter...
		Where are you? I call!
		Someone whispers:
		"Scream into the blue!"
		Shouted - and loudly
		Darkness rose up.
		Came out with a kitty
		Red fisherman.
		"Friend... Where are you from?"
		"Following you..."
		"Who are you?" - "Judas!" -
		Shamk zero surf.
		collapsed nests
		Cloud rice.
		star swallows
		They sank down.

		6

		Oh Sabaoth!
		Your cover of rivers and lakes
		Cover your son!
		Under the willow beat his howls
		And your snows are Calvary.
		O rainy cheeks
		break
		Sunset blade...
		Blizzard pipes
		Raise up tongues...
		But not to court or condemnation.

		7

		Appear over the Mount of Olives
		And the truth of our places!
		A handful of golden backwaters
		We will sprinkle your cross.
		The hills sing of a miracle
		The sand rings about paradise.
		Oh, I believe, I believe - it will be
		Calve your east!
		In the seas of oats and buckwheat and
		He throws us a heifer...
		But it's a long time to meet
		And death is so close!
		Stop the neighing of the storm
		And top of the thunders?
		Spill a bucket of azure
		To the old days!
		And let me get free
		Bear and sleep
		So that the leaked soul
		Fertilize black soil ...

		October 1917


* * *

		silver road,
		Where are you calling me?
		Pure Thursday candle
		There is a star above you.

		Are you sadness or joy?
		Or do you run to madness?
		Help me with your heart
		Love your hard snow.

		Give me the dawn on the firewood,
		Willow branch on a bridle.
		Maybe to the gates of the Lord
		I will bring myself.

		1917


* * *

		Open to me, guardian beyond the clouds,
		Blue doors of the day.
		White angel this midnight
		He took my horse away.

		God doesn't need more
		My horse is my power and strengthen.
		I hear how he neighs plaintively,
		Biting the golden chain.

		I see how he beats, rushes about,
		Pulling a tight lasso,
		And flies from him, like from a month,
		Wool buckskin in the fog.

TRANSFORMATION

Razumnik Ivanov

		1

		The clouds are barking
		The golden-toothed heights roar ...
		I sing and call:
		Lord, recline!

		Before the gates to heaven
		I knock:
		Swaddled with stars
		Talitsu Rus.

		My hand reaches for the clouds
		A song roars like a storm,
		heavenly milk
		Give me today.

		Your thunder roars menacingly,
		Sounds like the sound of wings.
		New Sodom
		Burns Yehudiel.

		But firmly, without looking back,
		Along the field of waters
		New from the red gates
		Lot comes out.

		2

		Isn't that why in birch
		The bush sings the cricket
		About how the pink face
		Dipped the rye east;

		About how the Mother of God,
		Throwing on a blue board,
		At the edge of the clouds
		Calls to the paradise of calves.

		In the morning over autumn
		I hear the call of the trumpet.
		calf titmouse
		It's about the verb of fate.

		"O believe, the sky will foam,
		Like barking, a wave will flash.
		Fawns over the grove
		Golden puppy moon.

		Other grass and more often
		The water will shade the world.
		murmuring robin
		A star will fly into the bushes.

		And crawl out of the ear,
		Like a swarm, wheat grass,
		To bee voice
		Lighten up the darkness..."

		3

		Hey Russians!
		Hunters of the universe
		Scooping up the sky with a seine of dawn, -
		Blow into the pipes.

		Under the plow of the storm
		The earth roars.
		Ruins the rocks golden-fanged
		Omezh.

		New sower
		Wandering through the fields
		New grains
		Throws into furrows.

		Bright guest in a rattletrap to you
		Rides.
		Runs through the clouds
		Mare.

		Harness on a mare -
		Xin.
		Bells on the collar -
		Stars.

		4

		Calm down, wind
		Don't bark, water glass.
		From heaven through red nets
		The milk will rain.

		The word swells with wisdom,
		Elm earing fields,
		Above the clouds, like a cow,
		Tail lifted dawn.

		I see you from the window
		Generous builder ,
		Robe above the earth
		Dangling heaven.

		Now
		The sun is like a cat
		From heavenly willow
		paw of gold
		Touches my hair.

		5

		The hour of transformation is ripening,
		He will come down, our bright guest,
		Of crucified patience
		Pull out the cracked nail.

		From u tra and from noon
		Under the thunder in the sky
		Like buckets, our everyday life
		He fills with milk.

		And from evening to night
		Never-ending glorifying land,
		Will prophesy by the stars
		Silvery harvest.

		And when a month is over the Volga
		Inclining his face to drink water, -
		He, hanging in a golden boat,
		Will float away to their gardens.

		And from the bosom of blue
		Waving the oar wide,
		Like an egg, we will drop the word
		With a hatched chick.

		November 1917




Poems of 1918



* * *

L. I. Kashina

		green hair,
		Maiden chest ,
		O thin birch,
		What did you look into the pond?

		What is the wind whispering to you?
		What is the sound of the sand?
		Or do you want to braid-branches
		Are you a moon comb?

		Reveal, reveal to me the secret
		Your tree thoughts
		I love sad
		Your pre-autumn noise.

		And a birch in response to me:
		"O curious friend,
		Starry night tonight
		Here the shepherd shed tears.

		The moon cast shadows
		Shone green.
		For bare knees
		He hugged me.

		So, take a deep breath.
		Said under the sound of branches:
		"Farewell, my dove,
		Till the new cranes ."

		August 15, 1918


* * *

		And heaven and earth are the same
		All in the same waters I look,
		But your icy sigh less often
		False classical Rus'.

		I will not protect my quiet shelter
		From joy over dying,
		But I'm sorry, sorry to give suffering
		Ezekiel 's voice of the winds.

		Noise, noise, roar harder
		Rage, rebellious ocean,
		And in the sun golden gulfs
		Chase down the silver perch.

		1918


* * *

		I won't be any
		I caress the girl.
		Ah, I love only one
		Forgetting earthly love
		Mother of God in heaven .

		In myself I am free to think,
		Spring sings in my heart.
		Ah, often in a dark cell
		I called her from the icon
		To your bed of sleep.

		And at the hour, as midnight beat,
		In the cheerful darkness of the night
		She went down like a shadow
		And the nipples flowed into the mouth
		Baby in the arms.

		And sitting next to me
		She whispered to me:
		"Humble up, my delight,
		We'll meet at the garden
		In the heavenly side."

		1918


CANTATA [1 - The first part was written by M. Gerasimov, the second - by S. Yesenin, the third - by S. Klychkov.]

		1

		Through the haze of bloody death
		Through suffering and sorrow
		We will see - believe, believe -
		Golden heights and distance.

		Everyone who was offended yesterday
		Bypassed by a dashing fate,
		From smoky factories, black huts
		We click into the light battle.

		Let the last be a tribute
		Our life and hard work.
		Believe, believe, there is beyond
		New dawns bloom.

		2

		Sleep, dear brothers,
		Homeland again
		Unwavering rati
		Moves under the walls of the Kremlin.

		New conceptions in the world,
		The glow of red lightning ...
		Sleep, dear brothers,
		In the light of imperishable tombs.

		The sun of evil with that seal
		Guards are at the gate...
		Sleep, dear brothers,
		An army is moving past you
		To the dawns of the universal people.

		3

		Come down from the cross, crucified people,
		Transform, damned enemy,
		You are threatened by fate
		For every wrong step you take.

		In the battle of the last there is no mercy,
		But there, beyond the limits of victories,
		We are glad to take you in our arms,
		Forgiving captivity for many years.

		Roar, earth, last storm,
		Call for a fight, call for a feast.
		Let the new day shine in azure
		Reshaping the old world.

		1918

		Here it is, stupid happiness
		With white windows to the garden!
		On the pond like a red swan
		A quiet sunset floats.

		Hello golden calm
		With the shadow of a birch in the water!
		Rooftop flock
		Serves vespers to the star.

		Somewhere beyond the garden timidly
		Where the viburnum blooms
		Tender girl in white
		He sings a gentle song.

		Spreads blue cassock
		From the field of the night chill ...
		Silly, sweet happiness
		Fresh rosy cheeks!

		1918


* * *

		I left my home
		Blue left Rus'.
		Three-star birch forest over the pond
		The warmth of an old mother's sadness.

		golden frog moon
		Spread out on still water.
		Like apple blossom, gray hair
		My father spilled in his beard.

		I won't be back soon!
		For a long time to sing and ring the blizzard.
		Guards blue Rus'
		Old maple on one leg

		And I know there's joy in it
		To those who kiss the leaves of the rain,
		Because that old maple
		Head looks like me.

		1918


* * *

		Good for autumn freshness
		Shake the soul-apple tree with the wind
		And watch how it cuts over the river
		Water blue sun with ha.

		It's good to knock out of the body
		Glowing song nail.
		And dressed in festive white
		Wait for the guest to knock.

		I'm learning, I'm learning with my heart
		Protect the color of bird cherry in the eyes,
		Only in stinginess feelings are heated,
		When the ribs break the flow.

		They say the star belfry hoots,
		Whatever the leaf, the candle dawn.
		I will not let anyone into the upper room,
		I won't open the door for anyone.

		1918


* * *

		Golden foliage swirled
		In the pinkish water of the pond
		Like a light flock of butterflies
		With fading flies to the star.

		I'm in love with this evening
		The yellowing dol is close to the heart.
		Youth-wind up to the shoulders
		Headed on a birch hem.

		And in the soul and in the valley coolness,
		Blue dusk like a flock of sheep
		Behind the gate of the silent garden
		The bell will ring and freeze.

		I have never been thrifty
		So did not listen to rational flesh,
		It would be nice, like willow branches,
		To tip over into the pink waters.

		It would be nice, on a haystack smiling,
		Muzzle of the month to chew hay ...
		Where are you, where are you, my quiet joy -
		Loving everything, wanting nothing?

		1918

Klyuev

		Now my love is not the same.
		Ah, I know, you grieve, grieve
		About that moon broom
		Poems did not splash puddles.

		Sad and rejoicing at the star,
		falling on your eyebrows,
		You sang out the heart of the hut,
		But he did not build a house in the heart.

		And the one you were waiting for in the night,
		Passed, as before, past the shelter.
		Oh friend, who are your keys
		Did you gild with the singing word?

		You can't sing about the sun
		You can't see heaven through the window.
		So the mill, waving its wing,
		Can't fly off the ground.

INONIA

Prophet Jeremiah

		1

		I do not rush to the lips of death,
		No spears, no arrows of rain, -
		That's what the Bible says
		Prophet Yesenin Sergey.

		My time has come
		I'm not afraid of the clang of the whip.
		Body, body of Christ,
		I spit out my mouth.

		I don't want to accept salvation
		Through his torment and the cross:
		I learned a different doctrine
		Stars that pierce eternity.

		I saw another coming -
		Where death does not dance over the truth.
		Like a sheep from filthy wool, I
		I will cut off the blue firmament.

		Raise my hands to the moon
		I'll crush it like a nut.
		I don't want heaven without stairs
		I don't want it to snow.

		I don't want to skillfully frown
		On the lakes of the dawn face.
		I blew like a chicken today
		Golden word egg.

		Today I have an elastic hand
		Ready to take over the world...
		Thunderstorm splashed blizzard
		From my shoulders eight wings .

		2

		The barking of bells over Russia is formidable -
		These are the walls of the Kremlin crying.
		Now on the peaks of the stars
		I lift you up, earth!

		Stretch to the invisible city
		I will bite through the milky cover.
		Even God I will pluck my beard
		The grin of my teeth.

		I'll grab him by the mane
		And I will tell him in the voice of a blizzard:
		I will make you different, Lord,
		To mature my verbal meadow!

		I curse the breath of Kitezh
		And all the hollows of his roads.
		I want to be on a bottomless hood
		We have erected a palace for ourselves.

		I will lick on the icons with my tongue
		Faces of martyrs and saints.
		I promise you the city of Inonia,
		Where does the Deity of the living live!

		Cry and weep, Muscovy!
		New came Indikoplo.
		All the prayers in your book of hours
		I will peck words with my beak.

		I will lead your people away from hope,
		I will give him faith and power,
		To plow it in early dawns
		Plowed the night with the sun.

		To field his verbal
		Growing beehives cereal,
		So that the grain under the roof of heaven
		They brightened the darkness like bees.

		I curse you, Radonezh,
		Your heels and all footprints!
		You are the fire of the golden deposit
		Loosened with a pick of water.

		A flock of your clouds, barking like wolves,
		Like a pack of angry wolves
		All those who call and all those who dare
		She pierced her fangs with a spear.

		Your sun with clawed paws
		Clawed into the soul like a knife.
		On the rivers of Babylon we wept,
		And bloody urine l us rain.

		Now the storms with the voice of an ox
		I scream, taking off Christ's pants:
		Wash your hands and hair
		From the pelvis of the second moon.

		I tell you, you will all die
		Faith moss will suffocate you all.
		In a different way over our bend
		Swell like an invisible cow God.

		And in vain they settle in caves
		Those who hate the roar.
		It doesn't matter - he will calve differently
		The sun in our Russian shelter.

		It doesn't matter - he will burn with calf,
		What forged the banks of the river.
		Unleash the world's boiling
		His golden horns.

		A new Olipius will come down
		Draw his new face.
		I tell you - I'll drink all the air
		And I'll stick out my tongue like a comet.

		I'll stretch my legs to Egypt,
		I'll undo the horseshoes of torment from you ...
		In both poles snowhorns
		I scream with the tongs of my hands.

		I will press the equator with my knee
		And, under the storm and whirlwind crying,
		In half our earth-mother
		I'll break it like a golden roll.

		And into the failure, shaded by the abyss,
		So that the whole world hears that crack,
		I head my head with stars
		I'll stick it out like sunshine.

		And four suns from the clouds,
		Like four barrels from a mountain
		Golden scattered hoops,
		Rolling down, shake up the worlds.

		3

		And I tell you America
		Broken off half of the earth -
		Fear the seas of unbelief
		Iron launch ships!

		Don't be dragged down by a cast-iron rainbow
		Niv and granite - rivers.
		Only the water of free Ladoga
		Will drill the life of people sheep!

		Do not drive with blue hands
		Into the wasteland the ceiling of heaven:
		Don't build with nailheads
		The glow of distant stars.

		Do not pour fire fermentation
		Lava steel ore.
		new ascension
		I will leave footprints on the ground.

		I hang my heels from the clouds,
		About the hoof of the clouds, like an elk;
		The wheels of the sun and the moon
		I'll put it on the earth's axis.

		I tell you - do not sing a prayer
		To your wire beams.
		They will not illuminate the comings,
		Running sheep through the mountains!

		There is still a shooter in you
		Shoot an arrow into his chest.
		Slowly the frying pan, from his white wool
		Warm blood spurts into the mist.

		Stars of golden hooves
		They roll down, furrowing the night.
		And again flashes with knitting needles
		Rain over her black stocking.

		I will then thunder with wheels
		Suns and moons like thunder;
		Like a fire, I'll mark my hair
		And I will cover my face with a wing.

		I will shake the mountains by the ears,
		I will stretch the feather grass with spears.
		All your tyny, all fences
		A handful will sweep away like dust.

		And I plow black cheeks
		Niv your new plow;
		Golden fly by magpie
		Harvest over your country.

		New on will reset the residents
		Wing spiked ringing.
		And, like golden poles, it will pull
		The sun's rays on the dol.

		New pines will grow
		On the palms of your fields.
		And like squirrels, yellow springs
		They will jump on the branches of days.

		Blue rivers will glimmer
		Having drilled all the obstacles of the blocks .
		And the dawn, lowering the eyelids,
		It will be stellar to catch fish in them.

		I tell you there will be time
		The mouths of thunders will spit;
		They pierce the blue crown
		Ears of your bread.

		And above the world from an invisible staircase,
		Announcing fields and meadows,
		Having hatched from the heart of the moon ,
		A rooster crows and crows.

		4

		I walk through the clouds, as if through a field,
		Hanging head down.
		I hear the splash of blue rain
		And a thin-billed whistle shone.

		Reflected in blue backwaters
		My distant lakes.
		I see you, Inonia,
		With golden caps.

		I see your fields and huts,
		On the porch of the old woman's mother;
		Sunset ray fingers
		She tries to catch.

		Pinch him at the window,
		Grabs on his hump -
		And the sun is like a cat
		Pulls the ball towards him.

		And quietly under the whisper of the river,
		Coastal echo in the hem,
		Drops of an invisible candle
		A song drips from the mountains:

		"Gloria
		And peace on earth!
		Moon with a blue horn
		Clouds pierced.

		Someone brought out a goose
		From the egg of a star -
		Light Jesus
		Peck traces.

		Someone with new faith
		Without cross and torment,
		I'll stretch on the sky
		Rainbow like an onion.

		Hail Sione,
		Shed your light!
		New in the sky
		Nazareth has matured.

		New on a mare
		Goes to the world Spas.
		Our faith is strong.
		Our truth is in us!"

		January 1918

		Oh sun, sun
		A golden bucket lowered into the world,
		Scoop up my soul!
		Take out of the well of torment
		My country.

		Every day,
		Grasping the chain of your rays,
		I'm climbing into the sky.
		Every evening
		I break and fall into the mouth of the sunset.

		It's hard and sad for me...
		The lips sing with blood ...
		Snows, white snows
		Cover of my homeland -
		Rip to pieces.

		Hanging on the cross
		Her body
		Shin roads and hills
		Killed...

		Howls like a wolf from the west
		Wind...
		Night like a raven
		It sharpens its beak on the eyes-lakes.
		And a board over the cross
		Ribita to the mountain dawn:

		JESUS NAZARENE
		TSAR
		JEWISH

		2

		Oh month, month!
		Red hat of my grandfather
		Thrown by a mischievous grandson on the boughs of the cloud,
		Fall to the ground...
		Cover my eyes!

		Where are you...
		Where is my home?

		I tore off your roads with lye
		Storm,
		Blue tongue licked your snow -
		Your white wool
		Wind...

		And you lie like a sheep
		Throwing feet into the sky
		Confusing the sky with a manger,
		confusing the stars
		With golden oats.

		Oh, confuse, confuse!
		Confuse everything you see...
		I will not refuse to accept you even with the sun ,
		Looks like a pig...

		I'm not afraid of his slipped patch
		Into the stockade
		my soul.

		Your secret is great.
		Your death is the font of the world
		Eternal.

		3

		O red evening dawn!
		Forgive me my cry.
		I'm sorry I confused your Bear
		With a scoop of a water carrier.

		Shepherds of the desert
		What do we know?

		Only the parish school
		I finished
		I only know the Bible and fairy tales,
		I only know that oats sing in the wind ...
		Yes, even
		On holidays
		Play harmonica.

		But I got...
		I believe it's better to die
		Than to stay
		With a torn
		Skin.

		Die, my land!
		Die, my Rus',
		Scribe
		Third
		Testament.

		4

		Oh stars, stars
		Wax thin candles
		Dripping red wax
		On the prayer book of the dawn,
		Bow down!

		Put on your flame,
		So that I can
		Standing on tiptoe
		Extinguish it.

		He did not understand who set you on fire,
		About what I sang to you
		Of death.

		Rejoice
		Earth!

		Virgin of your Rus'
		I announced the new
		Birth.
		son to you
		She will give birth...

		His name is
		Izramistil .

		Sing and make noise, Volga!
		She will overturn your blue manger
		Baby.
		Do not tell me,
		What is this
		In full circle
		will rise
		Moon...

		It is he!
		It is he
		From the womb of Heaven
		Will stick out
		Head...

JORDAN DOVE

		My land, patching!
		Autumn light temple!
		flock of noisy geese
		Rushing to the clouds.

		That is the soul of the transfigured
		innumerable army,
		Rising from sleepy lakes,
		Flies to the heavenly garden.

		And ahead of them is a swan.
		In the eyes, like a grove, sadness.
		Aren't you crying in the sky like that,
		Departed Rus'?

		Fly, fly, don't fight
		Everything has an hour and a shore.
		The winds flow into a song
		And the song will sink into the century.

		2

		The sky is like a bell
		The month is language
		Mother is my homeland
		I am a Bolshevik.

		For the sake of the universal
		Brotherhood of man
		I rejoice in the song
		From your death.

		Strong and strong
		To your death
		In the blue bell
		I've been beating for a month.

		lay brothers,
		You have my song.
		I hear in the fog
		Bright news.

		3

		Here she is, here is the dove,
		Sitting on the hand of the wind,
		The dawn swirls again
		My meadow Jordan an.

		I praise you blue
		Height driven by stars.
		Again to what paradise
		My hands went up.

		I see you, green fields,
		With a herd of brown horses.
		With a shepherd's pipe in the willows
		Apostle Andrew is wandering.

		And full of pain and anger
		There, on the outskirts of the village,
		Mother of the Blessed Virgin
		The rod whips the donkey.

		4

		My brothers, people, people!
		All of us, all of us someday
		We will be in those good villages,
		Where the Milky Way is trodden.

		Don't feel sorry for the departed
		Leaving every hour -
		There on the lilies of the valley blooming
		Better than m in our fields.

		Guardian of love - fate-bribery
		Happiness nurtures not a century.
		Who was your favorite today?
		Tomorrow is a beggar.

		5

		Oh new, new, new
		Cloud-cutting day!
		Sun-headed lad
		Sit under my fence.

		Give me your moose
		Comb the crest of the moon.
		This custom is a guest
		We have learned to meet.

		Ancient Shadow of Mauritius
		Related to our hills
		Rain in the golden fields
		Abraham visited us.

		Sit on my porch
		Quietly lean on your shoulder.
		blue star with a wreath
		I will light up before you.

		I will pray to you
		Praise your Jordan...
		Here she is, here is the dove,
		Sitting on the hand of the wind.

HEAVENLY DRUMMER

L. N. Stark

		1

		Hey you, slaves, slaves!
		stuck to the ground with your belly .
		Today the moon from the water
		The horses drank.

		Stars are shedding leaves
		In the rivers in our fields
		Long live the revolution
		On earth and in heaven!

		Throwing souls with bombs
		We sow a blizzard whistle.
		What do we saliva icon
		At our gates in the sky?

		Are we afraid of generals
		White herd of gorillas?
		Whirling cavalry is torn
		To the new shore of the world.

		2

		If it's the sun
		in conspiracy with them,
		We are his whole army
		Let's rise on bayonets.

		If this month
		Friend of their black power,-
		We do it with azure
		Stones in the back of the head

		Let's clear all the clouds
		Let's mix all the roads.
		We are the earth like a bell
		Attached to the rainbow.

		You call, call us
		Mother earth is damp
		About fields and groves
		Blue edge.

		3

		Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers
		A sparkling scourge over a tornado.
		Who wants freedom and brotherhood ,
		So there is no point in dying.

		Close up with a tight wall,
		Who hates fog
		That sun with a clumsy hand
		Rip off on a golden drum.

		Rip off and go along the roads
		To pour a call over the lakes of forces -
		On the shadows of churches and prisons,
		On the white herd burned l.

		In that call Kalmyk and Tatar
		They will feel their teasing hail,
		And the black sky with tails,
		The tails of the cows will ignite.

		4

		Believe us, victory is ours!
		The new coast is not far away.
		Waves of white claws
		Golden sand.

		Soon, soon the last shaft
		Milli it will sprinkle moons.
		The heart is a candle at dinner
		Easter masses and communes.

		Swarthy army, friendly army
		We are going to unite the whole world.
		We go, and blizzard dust
		A cloud of gorillas is melting.

		We go, and there, behind the thicket,
		Through whiteness and mist
		Our heavenly bar attendant
		Beats in the sun-drum.

Poems of 1919



* * *

		At the hour when the night will stick
		Moon on a black finger -
		Ah, about whom? Oh, who sings to
		About love nightingale-bastard?

		Is it possible to love now
		When the beast is erased from the heart?
		We go, we go gouge
		New doors.

		To hell with feelings. Words in manure
		Only the image and power of impulse!
		What is the sun to us? The entire stellar convoy -
		The golden stream of the team.

		What is India to us? What is Tolstoy?
		This wind that was, that was not.
		Today the man is just that
		Stares wider than the sky.

		January 1919


* * *

		Here is what it is
		I don't respect anyone
		I sing a golden weave,
		And the face is sometimes soot.

		They say that I am a Bolshevik.
		Yes, I'm glad to harness the land.
		Oh, what a bogomaz my face
		Drawn, thunderstorm e heeding?

		Let America, let London...
		Do the waters flow back?
		This is dancing Russian sadness,
		Washing away stains in the sun.

		February 1919


* * *

		Winds, winds, oh snowy winds,
		Notice my past life.
		I want to be a child of light
		Ile flower lump from the meadow boundary.

		I want a shepherd's whistle
		Die for yourself and for everyone.
		Star bells in the ears
		Pours evening snow.

		Its foggy trill is good,
		When he drowns the pain in a blizzard.
		I would like to stand like a tree
		On the road on one foot .

		I would like under horse snores
		Hug with a neighboring bush.
		Raise, you moon paws,
		My sadness in heaven with a bucket.

		1919-1920


* * *

		Soul mourns for heaven
		She is a tenant of otherworldly fields.
		I love it when in the trees
		The green fire moves .

		That boughs of golden trunks,
		Like candles, they glow before a mystery,
		And the stars of words bloom
		On their original foliage.

		I understand the earth's verb,
		But I will not shake off this flour,
		Like a dol reflected in the waters
		Suddenly a comet in the sky.

		So the horses do not shake off their tails
		In the ridges of their drinking moon ...
		Oh, if you could grow your eyes
		Like these leaves, in depth.

		1919


* * *

		Oh my god, my god, this depth
		Your blue belly
		Golden sun, like a navel,
		Looks into the Caspian mouth.

		Hooks of stars twisting into a thread
		Rays, you're catching us
		And you drop the days
		In the pupils of lake eyes.

		But in the fisherman's small vent
		The catfish does not swim.
		Do not drag the dawn with a seine
		me to your quiet house.

		Get down to the ground without trousers,
		Vzburli all the abyss and water,
		Resin boiling east
		Pour on our flesh.

		May the lips of fire burn
		Human passion and shame.
		Carry me like a dove
		To your skete in the blue groves.

		1919


PANTOKRATOR

		1

		Praise, my verse, who roars and rages,
		Who buries longing in the shoulder -
		Horse face of the month
		Shvat by the bridle of the rays.

		For thousands of years the same stars are famous,
		The same honey flows the flesh.
		Do not pray to you, but bark
		You taught me, Lord.

		For your curly gray hairs,
		For pennies from golden aspens
		I'm screaming at you: "To hell with the old!" -
		Recalcitrant robber son.

		And for these warm bounties,
		What do you ooze rain into the dregs,
		Oh, what, what brooms
		Shake the sun from the sky?

		2

		There, behind the milky hills,
		Among the heavenly poplars,
		Tipped over us
		Silver Jet Aquarius.

		He is a bear with azure,
		Like from a barrel with a scoop.
		A storm jumped into the sky
		She sat on horseback for a month.

		In the whirlwind dreams the host of the dead,
		Milk fuming garden.
		I see my grandfather is pulling the top
		Sun from noon to sunset.

		Father, father, are you a grandson
		Heard in this mournful period?
		To know , it's not for nothing that I tormented in my heart
		Breathing heifer.

		3

		Spin around, spin around, spin around
		The minting of your days is silver!
		I realized that the sun from above -
		A golden bucket in the well.

		From earth to invisible land
		I am destined to sail away.
		I myself will lay my soul
		On this burning bottom.

		But I know - with different eyes
		The dead smell the living.
		Oh give us earthly keys
		Appear at the gates of gold.

		Give with our oat will
		Knock down cast iron bolts,
		With a running start on a flat field
		Dawn jump on the backs.

		4

		Come down, appear to us, red horse!
		Harness yourself to the lands of the shafts.
		We got bitter milk
		Under this dilapidated roof.

		Spill, spill over the water for us
		Your muffled whining
		And a bell-star
		Cold glow.

		We are a rainbow to you - an arc,
		The Arctic Circle - on the harness.
		Oh , take out our globe
		On a different track.

		You cling to the ground with your tail,
		With the dawn, depart with a mane.
		For these clouds, this height
		Jump to the happy country.

		And let them, those who are in the dark
		We are drunk with a lamp in the sky,
		They will see from their fields,
		That we are going to visit them.

		February 1919


MARE SHIPS

		1

		If the wolf howled at the star,
		So the sky is covered in clouds.
		Torn bellies of mares,
		Black sails of ravens.

		Azure will not stick out its claws
		From a blizzard cough-stench;
		Flies under the neighing of storms
		Skulls evil atoconiferous garden.

		Do you hear? Do you hear a loud knock?
		This is a rake of dawn through the forests.
		With oars of severed hands
		You are rowing into the land of the future.

		Swim, swim high!
		Pour out the crow's cry from the rainbow!
		Soon the white tree will fall
		The head of my yellow leaf.

		2

		Field, field, who are you calling?
		Or I dream a cheerful dream -
		Rye rides like a blue cavalry,
		Overtaking forests and villages?

		No, not rye! Rides on&#769; cold field,
		The windows are broken, the doors are wide open.
		Even the sun freezes like a puddle,
		Which the gelding wove.

		Who is this? My Rus', who are you? Who?
		Whose scoop is in your snow scum?
		On the roads with a hungry mouth
		Suck the edge of the dawn of the dog.

		They don't need to run to "there"
		Here, it would be warmer to get along with people.
		God gave the child to the she-wolf
		The man ate the baby of the she-wolf.

		3

		Oh , who, who to sing
		In this frenzied glow of corpses?
		Look: women have the third
		The eye pops out of the navel.

		There he is! Get out, look at the moon,
		Will he see meaty bones.
		It can be seen in laughter at himself
		I sang a song about a wonderful guest.

		Where are you ? Where are eleven more
		What do boob lamps burn?
		If you want, poet, marry,
		So marry the sheep in the barn.

		Communion with straw and wool,
		Warm the song of verbal wax.
		Evil October showers rings
		From the brown hands of the birches.

		4

		Animals, animals, come to me
		Cry out anger into the cups of my hands!
		Isn't it time for the moon to stop
		Do clouds lap in the sky?

		bitch sisters and male brothers,
		I, like you, have people in the paddock.
		I don't need mares ships
		And crow's sails.

		If hunger from broken walls
		In clinging to my hair -
		I'll eat half my leg myself,
		I'll give you half to suck.

		I won't go anywhere with people
		It's better to die together with you,
		Than from your beloved to raise the earth
		Into the crazy passing stone.

		5

		I will sing, I will sing, I will sing!
		I won't hurt a goat or a hare.
		If there is anything to mourn,
		So you can smile.

		We all carry an apple of joy,
		And the robbery whistle is close to us.
		Cut wise gardener-autumn
		The head of my yellow leaf.

		There is only one path to the garden of dawn,
		will swallow the groves .
		Know everything, take nothing
		A poet has come into this world.

		He came to kiss the cows
		Listen to the oatmeal crunch with your heart.
		Deeper, deeper, sickles of poetry!
		Bird cherry rash, sun-bush!

		September 1919


HOOLIGAN

		cleans with wet brooms
		Willow droppings in the meadows.
		Spit, wind, armfuls of leaves, -
		I'm just like you, bully.

		I love when the blue thickets
		As with the heavy gait of an ox,
		Stomachs, wheezing leaves,
		Trunks are dirty on the knees.

		Here it is, my flock is red!
		Who could sing it better?
		I see, I see the twilight lick
		Traces of human feet.

		My Rus', wooden Rus'!
		I am your only singer and herald.
		Animal poems of my sadness
		I fed mignonette and mint.

		Breezy, midnight, moon pitcher
		Scoop up birch milk !
		Like he wants to strangle someone
		Graveyard with the hands of crosses!

		Black horror roams the hills,
		The malice of the thief flows into our garden,
		Only I myself am a robber and boor
		And by blood steppe horse thief.

		Who has seen how it boils in the night
		Boiled bird cherry army?
		I would like at night in the blue steppe
		Somewhere with a flail to stand.

		Ah, my bush withered my head,
		Sucked me song captivity.
		I am condemned to hard labor of feelings
		Turn the millstones of poems.

		But don't be afraid, crazy wind
		Spit calmly leaves in the meadows.
		The nickname "poet" will not erase me ,
		I'm in songs, like you, a bully.

		1919




Poems of 1920



* * *

Mariengof

		I am the last poet of the village
		The boardwalk bridge is modest in songs.
		Behind the farewell mass
		Birch trees stinging with leaves.

		Burn with golden flame
		Candle made of body wax
		And the moon clock is wooden
		My twelfth hour will croak.

		On the blue field path
		Iron guest coming soon.
		Oatmeal, spilled at dawn,
		Will collect his black handful.

		Not alive, alien palms,
		These songs will not live with you!
		Only there will be ears-horses
		About the owner of the old grieve.

		The wind will suck their neighing
		Funeral dance.
		Soon, soon wooden clock
		My twelfth hour will wheeze!

		1920


* * *

		An owl hoots in autumn
		Above the expanse of the road wound.
		Fly around my head
		A bush of golden hair fades.

		Field, steppe "ku-gu",
		Hello mother blue aspen!
		Soon a month, bathing in the snow,
		He will sit in his son's sparse curls.

		Soon I will get cold without leaves,
		Filling ears with the ringing of stars.
		Without me, young men will sing ,
		The elders will not listen to me.

		A new poet will come from the field,
		In the new forest, a whistle will be heard.
		The autumn wind blows
		Leaves whisper in autumn.

		1920


SOROKOST

A. Marienhof

		1

		Blows, blows the death horn!
		How can we be, how can we be now
		On muddy haunches of roads?
		You, lovers of song fleas,
		Would you like to suck on a gelding?

		It is full of meekness of muzzles to celebrate,
		Like it, not like it, take it.
		It's good when the twilight teases
		And they pour it into your fat asses
		The bloodied broom of the dawn.

		Soon freeze with lime will whiten
		That village and these meadows.
		There is nowhere for you to hide from death,
		There is no escape from the enemy.

		Here he is, here he is with an iron belly,
		Pulls five to the throats of the plains,
		Leads the old mill with his ear,
		He sharpened his flour-grinding scent.
		And the yard silent bull,
		That he spilled his whole brain on heifers,
		Wiping the tongue on the spinner,
		I sensed trouble over the field.

		2

		Oh, not from the other side of the village
		So the harmonica cries pitifully:
		Talia-la-la, tili-li-gom
		Hanging over a white window sill .
		And the yellow autumn wind
		Is it not because, touching the blue with ripples,
		As if from horses with a comb,
		Comb leaves from maples.
		He goes, he goes, a terrible messenger,
		The fifth bulky thicket aches.
		And the songs yearn more and more
		Under the frog squeak in the straw.
		Oh electric sunrise
		Belts and pipes deaf grip,
		Se hut wooden belly
		Shaking steel fever!

		3

		Have you seen
		How it runs through the steppes
		Hiding in lake mists,
		Snoring an iron nostril
		On the paws of a cast-iron train?

		And behind him
		On the big grass
		As at a feast of desperate races,
		Thin legs throwing to the head,
		Is the red-maned foal galloping?

		Dear, dear, funny fool
		Well, where is he, where is he chasing?
		Doesn't he know that living horses
		Did the steel cavalry win?
		really know that in the fields of the radiant
		That time will not return his run,
		When a couple of beautiful steppe Russians
		Did you give a Pecheneg for a horse?
		In a different way, fate repainted at the auction
		Our splash, awakened by the gnashing,
		And for thousands of pounds of horse skin and meat
		Until the locomotive falls now.

		4

		Damn you, nasty guest!
		Our song will not get along with you.
		It's a pity that you didn't have to as a child
		Drown like a bucket in a well.
		It's good for them to stand and watch
		Paint mouths in tin kisses -
		Only I, as a peddler, sing
		Above the native country "Hallelujah".
		That's why in the September skelete
		On dry and cold loam,
		Head smashed on the wattle fence,
		The rowan berries were covered with blood.
		That's why the sadness has grown
		In the busts of talyanka voiced.
		the man smelling of straw
		He choked on a dashing moonshine.

		August 1920


CONFESSION OF A HOOLIGAN

		Not everyone can sing
		Not everyone is given an apple
		Fall at someone else's feet.

		This is the greatest confession
		Which confesses a bully.

		I purposely go unkempt,
		With a head like a kerosene lamp on his shoulders.
		Your souls leafless autumn
		I like lighting in the dark.
		I like it when stones fight
		They fly at me like hail of a belching thunderstorm.
		I just shake my hands tighter then
		My hair is a swaying bubble.

		So good then I remember
		Overgrown pond and hoarse ringing of alder,
		That my father and mother live somewhere,
		Who don't give a damn about all my poetry
		To whom I am dear, like a field and like flesh,
		Like the rain that loosens the greenery in spring.
		They would come with a pitchfork to stab you
		For every cry you throw at me.
		Poor, poor peasants!
		You must have become ugly
		You are also afraid of God and the bowels of the swamp.
		Oh if you could understand
		That your son is in Russia
		The best poet!

		you not eaten with your heart for his life ,
		When he dipped his bare feet in puddles of autumn?
		And now he walks in a top hat
		And patent leather shoes.

		But the enthusiasm of the former correction lives in it
		Village mischief.
		To every cow from the butcher's sign
		He bows from afar.
		And, meeting with and zvozchik on the square,
		Remembering the smell of manure from native fields,
		He is ready to carry the tail of every horse,
		Like a wedding dress train.

		I love my homeland.
		I love my country very much!
		Though there is sadness in it, willow rust.
		Pleasant to me pigs dirty muzzles
		And in the silence of the night ringing voice of toads.
		I am tenderly ill with childhood memories,
		April evenings I dream of gloom and raw materials.
		As if squatting to warm up
		Our maple sat down before the fire of dawn.
		Oh, how many eggs I have on it from crows' nests,
		Climbing through the branches, stealing!
		Is he still the same now, with a green top?
		Is its bark still strong?

		And you, my love,
		Faithful piebald dog?!
		From old age you became shrill and blind
		And you wander around the yard, dragging a drooping tail,
		Forgetting intuition where the doors are and where the chl ev.
		Oh, how I love all those pranks
		When, having pulled off a loaf of bread from the mother,
		We bit her with you once,
		Not one bit buried by each other.

		I'm still the same.
		My heart is still the same.
		Like cornflowers in rye, eyes bloom in the face.
		A stele of verses evil matting,
		I want to tell you something tender.

		Good night!
		Good night to all of you!
		The scythe rang on the grass of the twilight of dawn ...
		I really want today
		Piss on the moon from the window.

		Blue light, the light is so blue!
		It's not even a pity to die in this blue .
		Well, so what, I seem like a cynic,
		Attached to the ass lantern!

		Old, kind, hackneyed Pegasus,
		Do I need your soft lynx?
		I came like a stern master
		Sing and praise the rats.
		My head is like August
		Flowing turbulent hair in another.

		I want to be yellow sail
		To the country where we are sailing.

		November 1920




Poems of 1921



SONG ABOUT BREAD

		Here it is, severe cruelty,
		Where is the whole point - the suffering of people!
		Sickle cuts heavy ears,
		How swans are cut down the throat.

		Our field has long been familiar
		With an August shiver in the morning.
		Tied up in sheaves of straw,
		Each sheaf lies like a yellow corpse.

		On carts, like hearses,
		They are taken to the grave crypt - a barn.
		Like a deacon, barking at a mare,
		The charioteer honors the funeral rank.

		And then them carefully, without anger,
		They lay their heads on the ground
		And flails little bones
		Knocked out of thin bodies.

		No one will get up in the head,
		That straw is also flesh!
		Cannibal-mill - teeth
		They put those bones in their mouths to grind them.

		And, fermenting the dough from the chalk,
		Heaps of delicious dishes are baked ...
		That's when the whitish poison enters
		Put eggs of malice in the jug of the stomach.

		All the beatings of rye in the baked dressing,
		Compressing the coarseness of the reapers into perfumed juice,
		He eats straw meat
		Poisons millstones and intestines.

		And they whistle all over the country like autumn,
		Charlatan, murderer and villain...
		Because the sickle cuts the ears,
		How swans are cut down the throat.

		1921


* * *

		Mysterious world, my ancient world,
		You, like the wind, calmed down and sat down.
		Here they squeezed the villages by the neck
		Stone arms of the highway.

		So scared in the snow
		There was a ringing horror.
		Hello my black doom
		I'm coming towards you!

		City, city, you're in a fierce fight
		He baptized us as carrion and scum.
		The field freezes in melancholy ,
		Choking on telegraph poles.

		Stringy muscle at the devil's neck,
		And the cast-iron duct is easy for her.
		Well, so what? It's not the first time for us
		And crumble and disappear.

		Let it be hard for the heart,
		This is a song of animal rights! ..
		... So the hunters poison the wolf ,
		Clutching in a vise roundups.

		The beast fell down ... and from the cloudy bowels
		Someone pull the trigger now...
		Suddenly a jump ... and a two-legged enemy
		Fangs are torn apart.

		Oh, hello, my beloved animal!
		You don't give yourself to the knife for nothing!
		Like you - I, we drive from everywhere,
		I pass among the iron enemies.

		Like you, I'm always ready
		And though I hear the victorious horn,
		But taste the enemy's blood
		My last, deadly jump.

		And let me on a loose vybel
		I'll fall and bury myself in the snow...
		Yet the song of vengeance for death
		They will sing to me on the other side.

		1921


* * *

		Are you my side, side!
		Rain, autumn tin.
		A cold lantern in a black puddle
		Reflects a lipless head.

		No, I'd rather not look
		To suddenly see the worst.
		I'm on all this rusty death
		I will squint my eyes and narrow.

		So a little warmer and painless.
		Look: between the skeletons of houses,
		Like a miller, the bell tower carries
		Copper bags of bells.

		If you are hungry, you will be full.
		If he is unhappy, then he is cheerful and glad.
		Just don't look open
		My earthly unknown brother.

		As I thought - so I did,
		But alas! All the same!
		Apparently, the body is too accustomed
		Feel this coldness and trembling.

		Well, so what? After all, many others
		I am not alone in the world!
		And the lantern will blink, then it will laugh
		Lipless with your head.

		Only a heart under shabby clothes
		Whispers to me, who visited the firmament:
		"My friend, my friend, clear eyelids
		Only death closes.
		1921


* * *

		I do not regret, do not call, do not cry,
		Everything will pass like smoke from white apple trees.
		Withering gold embraced,
		I won't be young anymore.

		Now you won't fight so much
		Cold touched heart
		And the country of birch chintz
		Not tempted to wander around barefoot.

		Wandering spirit! you are less and less
		You stir the flame of your mouth
		O my lost freshness,
		A riot of eyes and a flood of feelings.

		Now I have become more stingy in desires,
		My life? did you dream of me?
		Like I'm a spring echoing early
		Ride on a pink horse.

		All of us, all of us in this world are perishable,
		Quietly pouring copper from maple leaves ...
		May you be blessed forever
		That came to flourish and die.

		1921




Poems of 1922



FAREWELL TO MARIENGOFF

		There is a frantic happiness in friendship
		And a spasm of violent feelings -
		Fire melts the body
		Like a stearin candle .

		My beloved! give me hands
		I'm not used to it any other way,
		I want to wash them in the hour of separation
		I have yellow head foam.

		Ah, Tolya, Tolya, are you, are you,
		At what moment, at what time -
		Again, like milk, they froze
		Circles of unmoving eyes.

		Farewell, farewell . In the fires of the moon
		Can I have a happy day?
		Among the famous and young
		You were the best for me.

		At such and such a time, in such and such a year
		We will meet, maybe again...
		I'm scared - because the soul passes,
		Like youth and like love.

		The other in you will drown me out.
		Isn't that why - in harmony with speeches -
		My weeping ears
		How are the oars splashing on your shoulders?

		Bye Bye. In the fires of the moon
		Do not see me a joyful day,
		But still among the tremulous and young
		You were the best for me.

		1922


* * *

		All living things in a special way
		Noted from an early age.
		If I weren't a poet,
		That must have been a swindler and a thief.

		Skinny and undersized
		Among the boys is always a hero,
		Often, often with a broken nose
		I came to my home.

		And towards the frightened mother
		I squealed through a bloody mouth:
		"Nothing! I tripped on a stone
		It'll be up and running by tomorrow."

		And now, when I caught a cold
		These days, boiling water ligature,
		Restless, defiant strength
		Spilled on my poems.

		Golden, verbal heap,
		And over every line without end
		Reflecting the former prowess
		Bully and tomboy.

		As then, I am brave and proud,
		Only new my step splashes ...
		If before they hit me in the face,
		Now the whole soul is in the blood.

		And I already say not to my mother,
		And in a strange and laughing from the ford:
		"Nothing! I tripped on a stone
		It will all heal by tomorrow!"

		1922


* * *

		Do not swear. Such a thing!
		I'm not a trader in words.
		Tilted over and weighed down
		My golden head

		There is no love for either the village or the city,
		How could I convey it to you?
		I'll drop everything. I'll grow my beard
		And I will go as a vagabond in Rus'.

		Forget poems and books
		I will throw a bag over my shoulders,
		Because in the fields the bastard
		The wind sings more than to whom.

		I stink of radishes and onions
		And, disturbing the evening surface,
		I will blow my nose loudly into my hand
		And play the fool in everything.

		And I don't need better luck
		Just forget and listen to the blizzard
		Because without these eccentricities
		I can't live on earth.

		1922


* * *

		I won't deceive myself
		Concern lay in the misty heart.
		father a charlatan?
		Why am I known as a brawler?

		I am not a villain and I did not rob the forest,
		He did not shoot the unfortunate in dungeons.
		I'm just a street rake
		Smiling at the faces.

		I am a Moscow mischievous reveler.
		All over the Tver region
		In the lanes every dog
		Knows my easy gait.

		Every wretched horse
		He nods his head towards me.
		For animals, I'm a good friend,
		Every verse heals my soul of the beast.

		I walk in a top hat not for women -
		In a stupid passion, the heart is not strong enough to live, -
		It is more comfortable in it, reducing your sadness,
		Give the gold of oats to the mare.

		Among people I have no friendship,
		I submitted to another kingdom.
		Every dog here on the neck
		I'm ready to give away my best tie.

		And now I won't get sick.
		The mist in the heart cleared up .
		That's why I was known as a charlatan,
		That's why I was known as a brawler.

		1922


* * *

		Yes! Now it's decided. no return
		I left my native fields.
		They will no longer be winged foliage
		I need to ring poplars.

		The low house stoops without me ,
		My old dog is long gone.
		On Moscow's winding streets
		To die, to know, God judged me.

		I love this elm city
		Let him be flabby and let him be deaf.
		Golden drowsy Asia
		Rested on the domes.

		And when the moon shines at night,
		When the light is on ... the devil knows how!
		I walk with my head down
		Alley to a familiar tavern.

		Noise and din in this creepy lair,
		But all night long, until dawn,
		I read poetry to prostitutes
		And with the bandits I fry alcohol.

		Heart beats faster and faster
		And I say out of place:
		"I'm just like you, lost,
		I can't go back now."

		The low house will stoop without me,
		My old dog is long dead.
		On Moscow's winding streets
		To die, to know, God judged me.

		1922


* * *

		Drinking here again, fighting and crying
		According to the harmonica, yellow sadness.
		Cursing their failures
		Remember Muscovite Rus'.

		And I myself, bowing my head,
		I fill my eyes with wine
		So as not to see the fateful face,
		To think for a moment about something else.

		Something is lost forever.
		May my blue! June blue!
		Isn't that why it smells like carrion
		Over the abyss of this revelry.

		Ah, today is so much fun for the Russians,
		Moonshine alcohol - a river.
		Harmonist with a sunken nose
		They sing about the Volga and about the Cheka.

		Something evil in the eyes of the insane,
		Recalcitrant in loud speeches.
		They feel sorry for those foolish, young,
		Who ruined their lives in a rush.

		Where are you, those who have gone far away?
		Do our rays shine brightly for you?
		Harmonist alcohol treats syphilis,
		What I received in the Kyrgyz steppes.

		No! do not crush them, do not disperse them.
		Recklessness is given to them by rot.
		You, my scattering ... Ras ... sowing ...
		Asian side!

		1922


* * *

		Rash, harmonica. Boredom... Boredom...
		The harmonist pours his fingers in a wave.
		Drink with me you lousy bitch
		Drink with me.

		Loved you, scourged -
		Unbearable.
		Why are you looking so blue splashes?
		Do you want it in the face?

		In the garden you would be stuffed,
		Frighten crows.
		Tormented me to the liver
		From all sides.

		Rash, harmonica. Rash, my frequent.
		Drink, otter, drink.
		I'd rather be that busty one over there, -
		She is dumber.

		I'm not the first among women...
		a lot of you
		But with someone like you, with a bitch
		Only for the first time.

		The freer, the louder
		Here and there.
		I won't end myself
		Go to hell.

		To your pack of dogs
		It's time to forgive.
		Darling I'm crying
		Sorry Sorry...

		1922


* * *

		Sing, sing. On the damn guitar
		Your fingers dance in a semicircle.
		Would choke in this frenzy,
		My last, only friend.

		Don't look at her wrists
		And flowing silk from her shoulders.
		I was looking for happiness in this woman ,
		And accidentally found death.

		I didn't know love was contagious
		I didn't know love was a plague.
		Came up with a slitted eye
		The bully went crazy.

		Sing, my friend. call me again
		Our former violent early.
		Let her kiss each other
		Young beautiful bastard.

		Oh wait. I don't scold her.
		Ah, wait. I don't curse her.
		Let me play about myself
		Under this bass string.

		The days of my pink dome are pouring.
		In the heart of dreams of gold sums.
		I touched a lot of girls
		He pressed many women in the corners.

		Yes! there is the bitter truth of the earth,
		I peeped with a childish eye:
		Males lick in line
		Bitch dripping juice

		So why should I be jealous of her.
		So why should I hurt like this.
		Our life is a sheet and a bed.
		Our life is a kiss and a whirlpool.

		Come on, sing! On a fatal scale
		These hands are a fatal misfortune.
		Just know, send them...
		I will not die, my friend, never.

Poems of 1923



* * *

		Joy is given to the rude,
		Gentle is given sadness.
		I need nothing,
		I don't feel sorry for anyone.

		I feel sorry for myself a little
		Pity the homeless dogs.
		This straight road
		She took me to a tavern.

		Why are you arguing, devils?
		Am I not a son of the country?
		Each of us pledged
		For a glass of your pants.

		I dimly look at the windows,
		In the heart of longing and heat.
		Rolling, wet in the sun,
		Street in front of me.

		And on the street the boy is snotty.
		The air is fried and dry.
		The boy is so happy
		And picks his nose.

		Pick, pick, my dear,
		Stick your whole finger in there
		Only now with ephta force
		Don't get into your soul.

		I'm ready ... I'm timid ...
		Look at the bottles!
		I collect corks -
		Shut up my soul.

		1923


cigarettes

		The streets are sad
		Snowdrifts and frost.
		Desperate tomboys
		With trays of cigarettes.
		Dirty street wanderers
		In the fun of an evil game
		All of them are pickpockets ,
		Merry thieves.
		Those area - on Nikitskaya,
		And these - on Tverskaya.
		They stand with a sad whistle
		They are there all day long.
		They scurry around all the haunts
		And, having improved leisure,
		Reading Pinkerton
		Over a mug of beer out loud.
		Let the beer be bitter
		They are without beer and - completely.
		Everyone is crazy about New York
		Everyone is drawn to San Francis.
		Then sad again
		Out into the cold
		Desperate tomboys
		With trays of cigarettes.

		1923


* * *

		This street is familiar to me
		And this low house is familiar.
		wire blue straw
		The tip hovered over the window.

		There were years of severe disasters,
		Years of violent, insane forces.
		I remember my village childhood
		I remembered the rustic blue.

		I did not seek glory or peace,
		I am familiar with the vanity of this glory.
		And now, when I close my eyes,
		I see only my parents' house.

		I see a garden covered in blue
		Quietly August lay down on the wattle fence.
		They hold lindens in green paws
		Bird chirping and chirping.

		I loved this wooden house
		A formidable wrinkle glimmered in the logs,
		Our stove is somehow wild and strange
		Howled on a rainy night.

		The voice is loud and the sob is loud,
		As about someone dead, alive.
		What did he see, a brick camel,
		In the howl of the rain?

		It can be seen that he saw distant countries,
		The dream of another and blooming pore,
		The golden sands of Afghanistan
		And the glass cloud of Bukhara .

		Oh, and I know these countries -
		He traveled a long way there.
		Only closer to the native land
		I would like to turn around now.

		But that gentle slumber faded away,
		Everything rotted in blue smoke.
		Peace to you is field straw,
		Peace to you - a wooden house!

* * *

		I have never been so tired.
		Into this gray frost and slime
		I dreamed of the Ryazan sky
		And my unlucky life.

		Many women loved me
		Yes, and I myself loved more than one,
		Isn't this the dark force
		She taught me to be guilty.

		Endless drunken nights
		And in revelry, longing is not the first time!
		Isn't it sharpening my eyes,
		Like a blue leaf worm?

		No betrayal hurts me
		And the ease of victories does not please, -
		That hair is golden hay
		Turns to grey.

		Turns to ashes and water
		When the autumn haze sifts.
		I do not feel sorry for you, the past years, -
		I don't want to return anything.

		I'm tired of torturing myself aimlessly,
		And with a smile of a strange face
		I liked to wear in a light body
		Quiet light and peace of the dead...

		And now it's not even hard
		Waddling from den to den,
		Like a straitjacket
		We take nature into concrete.

		And in me, according to the same laws,
		The furious ardor subsides.
		But still I treat with a bow
		To those fields that once loved.

		To those parts where I grew up under a maple,
		Where I frolicked on the yellow grass, -
		I send greetings to sparrows and ravens,
		And an owl sobbing into the night.

		I shout to them in the spring gave:
		"The birds are cute, in blue shivers
		Tell me what I scandalized -
		Let the wind now begin
		To bludgeon rye under mittens.

		1923


* * *

		I have only one fun:
		Fingers in the mouth - and a cheerful whistle.
		Bad fame swept
		That I am a brawler and a brawler.

		Oh! what a ridiculous loss!
		There are many funny losses in life.
		I'm ashamed that I believed in God.
		I'm sorry that I don't believe it now.

		Golden , distant distances!
		Everything burns worldly dream.
		And I was rude and scandalous
		To burn brighter.

		The poet's gift is to caress and scratch,
		Fatal seal on it.
		White rose with black toad
		I wanted to get married on earth.

		Let them not get along, let them not come true
		These thoughts of pink days.
		But if the devils nested in the soul -
		So the angels lived in it.

		That's for this fun turbidity,
		Going with her to another land,
		I want last minute
		Ask those who will be with me -

		So that for everything for my grave sins,
		For disbelief in grace
		They put me in a Russian shirt
		Under the icons to die.

		1923


* * *

		A blue fire swept
		Forgotten relatives gave.
		For the first time I sang about love,
		For the first time I refuse to scandal.

		I was all - like a neglected garden,
		He was greedy for women and potion.
		Enjoyed drinking and dancing
		And lose your life without looking back.

		I would just look at you
		To see the eye of a golden-brown whirlpool,
		And so that, not loving the past,
		You couldn't leave for someone else.

		Tread gentle, light camp,
		If you knew with a stubborn heart,
		How does a bully know how to love,
		How can he be humble.

		I would forever forget taverns
		And I would give up writing poetry,
		Just to gently touch the hand
		And your hair color in autumn.

		I would follow you forever
		At least in their own, even in others they gave ...
		For the first time I sang about love,
		For the first time I refuse to scandal.

		1923


* * *

		You are as simple as everyone else
		Like a hundred thousand others in Russia.
		Do you know the lonely dawn
		You know the cold of autumn is blue.

		Ridiculously , I got stuck in my heart,
		I thought stupidly.
		Your iconic and strict face
		In the chapels hung in Ryazan.

		I spit on these icons,
		I honored rudeness and shouting in the rake,
		And now suddenly the words are growing
		The most tender and meek songs.

		I don't want to fly to the zenith,
		The body needs too much.
		Why is your name ringing
		Like an August chill?

		I am not a beggar, nor pathetic, nor small
		And I can hear behind the ardor:
		Since childhood, I understood to like
		Males and steppe mares.

		That's why I didn't save myself.
		For you, for her and for this one.
		A pledge of unhappy happiness -
		The crazy heart of a poet.

		That's why I'm sad, having settled,
		As if in the leaves in the eyes slanting ...
		You are as simple as everyone else
		Like a hundred thousand others in Russia.

		1923


* * *

		Let you be drunk by others
		But m is not left, I am left
		Your hair is glassy smoke
		And eye autumn fatigue.

		O age of autumn! He me
		Dearer than youth and summer.
		You began to like doubly
		Poet's imagination.

		My heart never lies
		And therefore, to the voice of swagger
		safely say
		That I say goodbye to hooliganism.

		It's time to part with the mischievous
		And relentless courage.
		Another heart has already drunk,
		Sobering blood.

		And knocked on my window
		September with a crimson willow branch,
		So that I was ready and met
		His arrival is unpretentious.

		Now I put up with a lot
		No compulsion, no loss.
		Rus' seems different to me,
		Others - cemeteries and huts.

		Transparently I look around
		And I see if it's there, it's here, it's somewhere,
		That you are alone, sister and friend,
		Could be a poet's companion.

		That I could only you
		Growing up in perseverance
		Sing about the twilight of the roads
		And outgoing hooliganism.

		1923


* * *

		Honey, let's sit down
		Let's look into each other's eyes.
		I want under the meek gaze
		Listen to the sensual blizzard.

		autumn gold
		This strand of white hair -
		Everything appeared as salvation
		Restless rake.

		I left my land a long time ago
		Where meadows and thickets bloom.
		In urban and bitter glory
		I wanted to live lost.

		I wanted the heart to be muffled
		I remembered the garden and summer,
		Where to the music of frogs
		I raised myself as a poet.

		It's autumn there now...
		Maple and lindens in the windows of the rooms,
		Throwing branches with paws,
		Looking for those who remember.

		They've been gone for a long time.
		A month on a simple churchyard
		On the crosses it marks with rays,
		That we will come to visit them,

		That we, having outlived anxiety,
		Let's go under these bushes.
		All wavy roads
		Only joy is poured to the living.

		Honey, sit down next to me
		Let's look into each other's eyes.
		I want under the meek gaze
		Listen to the sensual blizzard.

		1923


* * *

		I'm sad to look at you
		What a pain, what a pity!
		Know only willow copper
		We stayed with you in September.

		Someone else's lips smashed
		Your warmth and awe of the body.
		Like it's raining
		From the soul, a little dead.

		Well! I am not afraid of him.
		Another joy opened up to me.
		'Cause there's nothing left
		As soon as yellow decay and dampness.

		After all, I did not save myself
		For a quiet life, for smiles.
		So few roads traveled
		So many mistakes have been made.

		Funny life, funny discord.
		So it was and so it will be after.
		Like a graveyard, a garden is dotted
		Gnawed bones in birches.

		This is how we bloom
		And let's make some noise, like guests of the garden ...
		If there are no flowers in the middle of winter,
		So there is no need to worry about them.

		1923


* * *

		Don't torment me with coolness
		And don't ask me how old I am
		Possessed by severe epilepsy,
		I became a soul, like a yellow skeleton.

		There was a time when from the suburbs
		I dreamed like a boy - in the smoke,
		That I'll be rich and famous
		And that I will be loved by all.

		Yes! I'm rich, over-rich.
		There was a cylinder, but now it's gone.
		Only one shirt left
		With a fashionable pair of beaten boots.

		And my fame is not worse, -
		From Moscow to Parisian dud
		My name is terrifying
		Like a fence, loud abuse.

		And love, isn't it funny?
		You kiss, and your lips are like tin.
		I know my feeling is overripe
		And yours will not be able to flourish.

		It's too early for me to grieve
		Well, if there is sadness - it does not matter!
		Golden your braids over the mounds
		Young noisy quinoa.

		I would like to go back to that area
		So that, under the noise of a mole, an ode of swans
		Drown forever into the unknown
		And dream like a boy - in the smoke.

		But dream about something else, about something new,
		Incomprehensible earth and grass,
		What the heart cannot express in words
		And he does not know to name the person.

		1923


* * *

		The evening furrowed black eyebrows.
		Someone 's horses are standing by the yard.
		Was it not yesterday that I drank away my youth?
		Did I fall out of love with you not yesterday?

		Don't snore, belated trio!
		Our lives have gone by without a trace.
		Maybe tomorrow a hospital bed
		Will put me at ease forever.

		Maybe tomorrow will be different
		I'll leave , healed forever,
		Listen to the songs of rain and bird cherry,
		How does a healthy person live?

		I will forget the dark forces
		That tormented me, ruining.
		Sweet look! Cute look!
		Only one I will not forget you.

		Let me love another
		But with her, with her beloved, on the other,
		I'll tell you about you dear
		That once I called dear.

		I'll tell you how the past flowed
		Our life that was not the former ...
		Are you my daring head
		What have you brought me to?

Poems of 1924



* * *

		The years are young with a tambourine glory,
		I myself poisoned you with a bitter poison.

		I don't know if my end is near or far
		There were blue eyes, but now faded.

		Where are you, joy? Darkness and horror, sad and insulting.
		In the field, right? In a pub? I can not see anything.

		I stretch out my hands, and now I listen to the touch:
		We are going ... horses ... sleighs ... snow ... we are passing a grove.

		"Hey, coachman, carry with might and main! Tea, born not weak!
		It's not a pity to shake your soul over such potholes. "

		And the coachman answered one thing: "In such a snowstorm
		It is very scary that the horses sweat on the way.

		"You, coachman, I see, you are a coward. It's out of our hands!"
		I took a whip and whipped on the horse's backs.

		I beat, and the horses, like a blizzard, carry the snow into flakes.
		Suddenly a push ... and from the sleigh straight to the snowdrift I am.

		I got up and see: what the hell - instead of a brisk troika ...
		Bandaged, I lie in a hospital bed.

		And instead of horses on the road shaking
		I beat the hard bed with a bandage.

		Hands twirled on the face of the clock.
		Sleepy nurses leaned over me.

		They leaned over and wheezed: "Oh, you, golden-headed,
		You poisoned yourself with bitterness from Rava.

		We don't know if your end is near or far,
		Your blue eyes got wet in the taverns.

		1924


MOTHER'S LETTER

		Are you still alive, my old lady?
		I'm alive too. Hello you, hello!
		Let it flow over your hut
		That evening unspeakable light.

		They tell me that you, concealing anxiety,
		She was very sad about me,
		What do you often go to the road
		In an old-fashioned ramshackle.

		And you in the evening blue darkness
		We often see the same thing:
		Like someone is in a tavern fight for me
		He put a Finnish knife under the heart.

		Nothing, dear! Calm down.
		It's just painful bullshit.
		I'm not such a bitter drunkard,
		To die without seeing you.

		I'm still just as gentle
		And I only dream about
		So that rather from rebellious longing
		Return to our low house.

		I 'll be back when the branches spread
		In spring, our white garden.
		Only you me already at dawn
		Don't wake up like eight years ago.

		Don't wake up what you dreamed
		Don't worry about what didn't come true -
		Too early loss and fatigue
		I got to experience it in my life .

		And don't teach me to pray. No need!
		There is no return to the old.
		You are my only help and joy,
		You are my only inexpressible light.

		So forget your worries
		Don't be so sad about me.
		Don't go to the road so often
		In an old- fashioned shawl.

		1924

		Nice publisher! In this book
		I indulge in new feelings
		Learning to comprehend in every moment
		Commune rearing Rus'.

		Let about a lot of clumsily
		Pencil whispered to paper
		The soul sang hoarsely awake,
		Not understanding our holiday.

		But you are the poet's vision
		You will read not in letters, but in another,
		That in the country where the power of the Soviets,
		Do not write in the old language.

		And, analyzing the bold experience,
		Do not betray me to ridicule -
		Just because it's so inept
		Pencil whispered to paper.

		1924


IN THE CAUCASUS

		Since ancient times our Russian Parnassus
		Drawn to unfamiliar countries,
		And most of all, only you, the Caucasus,
		It rang with a mysterious mist.

		Here Pushkin in sensual fire
		He wrote with his disgraced soul:
		"Do not sing, beauty, with me
		You are the sad songs of Georgia .

		And Lermontov, curing melancholy,
		He told us about Azamat,
		How is he for Kazbich's horse
		He gave his sister instead of gold.

		For sadness and bile in your face
		Boiling yellow rivers worthy,
		He, like a poet and an officer,
		Was calmed down by a friend's bullet.

		And Griboyedov is here for the dig,
		As our tribute to the Persian gloom,
		At the foot of a big mountain
		He sleeps to the cry of zurna and tari.

		And now I'm in your smoothness
		Came without knowing the reason:
		Is it to mourn native ashes here
		Or spy on your hour of death!

		I don't care! I am full of thoughts
		About them, gone and great.
		They were healed by guttural noise
		Your valleys and wild rivers.

		They fled from enemies
		And they fled here from friends,
		Just to hear the sound of footsteps
		Yes, to see from the mountains deaf gave.

		And I am from the same evils and troubles
		He fled, forever saying goodbye to the bohemia,
		Zane matured in me a poet
		With a big epic theme.

		I love poetry Russian heat.
		There is Mayakovsky, there is and besides,
		But he, their chief staff painter,
		Sings about traffic jams in Mosselprom.

		And Klyuev, the deacon from Ladoga,
		His poems are like a quilted jacket,
		But I read them aloud yesterday,
		And the canary died in the cage.

		Nothing else to count
		They ripen under the cold sun,
		Even mess up the papers
		And they don't know how to do it right.

		Forgive me, Caucasus, what am I talking about them
		I told you inadvertently
		You teach my Russian verse
		Ki zilovy juice flow,

		So that, returning again to Moscow,
		I could with the most beautiful poem
		Forget unnecessary longing
		And never be friends with Bohemians.

		And so that one in my country
		I could repeat in my farewell hour:
		"Do not sing, beauty, with me
		You are the songs of sad Georgia.

IN MEMORY OF BRYUSOV

		We are dying
		We descend into silence and sadness,
		But I know
		Rus' will not forget us.

		Loved the girls
		We loved women
		And they ate bread
		From a beggar's bag.

		But we didn't love
		Selling merchants.
		Planet , dear, -
		Roll, walk and drink.

		We rhyme old
		Repeat forty times.
		Let us be able
		Gogol and smoke.

		But still we were
		Always alone.
		My dear friend,
		Do not complain, do not curse!

		Here Bryusov died,
		But we will die,
		Don't ask us for days
		From a beggar's bag.

		But firmly stuck
		We are in poverty.
		Valery Yaklevich!
		Peace to your ashes!

"Dawn of the East"

		So sad on earth
		As if in an apartment
		In which the year did not wash, do not grind.
		Some bullshit in this world
		The Bolsheviks brought it on purpose.

		Lermontov's sail flickers from books,
		And in my head is the lousy Sir Curzon.
		"I'm bored, demon!"
		"What to do, Faust?"
		This is the limit for you, so it's set.

		Irony! Take me! Take it!
		Ryazan peasant screwing up his eye,
		Wherever you turn, all paths converge
		Edited by Zarya Vostoka.

		Nice to see you, comrade Livshits,
		Like in a lake, look into your kind eyes,
		But, clinging to the wet galleys,
		Kara-Murza has been secretary for you.

		And Akhobadze...! Others, be deaf
		Do not come in awe , nor in delight, -
		Financial Maestro Lopatukhin
		He starts bargaining with me for lines.

		You can die from invisible boredom.
		In a paper lake forever to drown!
		Instead of Karpov, I see all the pikes,
		Fish teeth disturbing the brain and chest.

		Poet! Poet!
		We need money. Yes!
		Either the shoes burst, then the hat was frayed,
		Although Virap would give a thousand for a book,
		But can you take a thousand from Virap.

		Verzhbitsky Kolya!
		Also a good friend
		Give poetry, and he them in the ass,
		Under the ads, where trusts and galoshes,
		As if I were a friend and brother of galoshes.

		I am not deceived by the ringing of these regalia,
		I do not give myself to glory or vanity,
		Offended Ben-Gali stuck in the shower
		With an incurable hole in the stomach.

		Will I wait for a day and a joyful period,
		Will my sad deeds get better?
		You are amazing, "Dawn of the East",
		But "Western" you would be better.

		1924


MEMORY

		Now October is not the same
		Not that October now.
		In a country where bad weather whistles,
		Roared and howled
		October is like a beast
		October of the seventeenth.

		I remember creepy
		Snowy day.
		I saw him with a dull eye.
		iron vital shadow
		"Over the darkened Petrograd".

		Everyone already smelled the storm.
		Everyone already knew something.
		knew
		What is not in vain, to know, they are taking
		Turtle soldiers made of steel.

		Scattered...
		Sit in a row...
		The public's veins are trembling...
		And someone suddenly ripped off the poster
		From the walls of the cowardly Constituent Assembly.

		And it started...
		Eyes flickered
		War of civil grief,
		And cannon smoke from the Aurora
		The iron dawn has risen.

		The fatal fate has come to pass,
		And over the country to the cries of "mats "
		Fire inscription shot up:
		"Soviet of Workers' Deputies".

		1924


LEV POVITSKY

		Old friend!
		I see you again
		Through the long and cold
		Separation.
		I'm squeezing
		my dear hand
		And I say, as before,
		About love.

		I love you
		With look.
		Feel sad
		And caress a little.
		I'm not like that anymore
		How to continue -
		bushy,
		Proud nerd.

		We got carried away
		What to hide?
		I'm not me...
		Is it you, is it you?
		Along the banks
		Sea surface -
		like a horse
		Hunted, in soap.

		Now in love
		In someone I
		I love and in vain
		I urge
		But still
		ship point
		To the beloved land
		I'm sailing.

		1924


FLOWERS

		I

		Flowers tell me goodbye
		Heads nodding low.
		You won't see close anymore
		Native field, fatherland.

		Favorite! Well, well, well!
		I saw you and I saw the earth
		And this deathly trembling
		How to accept a new kindness.

		II

		Spring evening. Blue hour.
		Well, how can I not love you,
		How can I not love you, flowers?
		I would drink with you on "you".

		Shumi, levkoy and mignonette.
		My soul is in trouble.
		Trouble has befallen my soul.
		Shumi, levkoy and mignonette.

		III

		Ah, the bell! is your fervor
		Called me in the soul with a song
		And said that cornflowers
		The eyes of loved ones are far away.

		Do not sing! Don't sing to me! Have mercy.
		And so the fire burns in the chest.
		She came like to rhyme "again"
		Inseparable love.

		IV

		My flowers! Not everyone could
		To know that my heart is cold,
		Not all this cold in it
		Could melt with his fire.

		Not everyone, who stretched out their hands,
		Will be able to catch the evil share.
		Like a butterfly - I'm on a fire
		I fly and kiss the fire.

		V

		I don't like flowers from the bushes
		I don't call them flowers.
		Though I touch them with my lips,
		But I can not find tender words for them.

		I only love the flower
		Which is rooted in the ground.
		I love him and accept him
		Like our northern cornflower.

		VI

		And there are flowers on the mountain ash,
		Flowers are the forerunners of berries
		They will fall on the ground like a hail,
		Crimson overthrowing from a height.

		They are not the ones on earth.
		Rowan flowers are another matter.
		They are like life, like our body,
		Divisible in the predvechnoy haze.

		VII

		My love! Sorry Sorry.
		I didn't bypass anything.
		But I prefer on the way
		Which is unique to me.

		You and I are unique.
		If we die, others will come for us.
		But it's still not like that -
		I'm not yours, you're not mine.

		VIII

		Flowers , tell me goodbye
		Heads nodding low
		What can't be seen up close
		Her face, beloved land.

		Well! let's not see.
		I'm amazed by another bloom
		And therefore verbal singing
		I will praise the surface of the earth.

		IX

		Aren't people flowers?
		Oh baby, feel it
		There are no empty words here.
		Like a stem shaking its body,

		Is this head
		Don't you have a golden rose?
		Flowers of people both in the sun and in the cold
		They are able to crawl and walk.

		X

		I saw the flowers walk
		And since then my heart has become kinder,
		When I found out that in this world
		That case was in October.

		Flowers fought each other
		And the red color was all fighting.
		They fell more under the blizzard,
		But still with the power of elastic
		They killed the executioners.

		XI

		October! October!
		I'm terribly sorry
		Those red flowers that fell.
		The head of a rose is cut by steel,
		But still I'm not afraid of steel.

		Flowers walking earth!
		They and steel will fight cleaner,
		Ships will be launched from steel
		Houses will be made of steel.

		XII

		And because I realized
		That the world is not a monastic schema for me ,
		I tenderly put into the verse,
		That everything in the world is repeatable.

		And because I sing
		I sing and not in vain,
		I have my sweet head
		I'll give it like a golden rose.

		1924


BATUUM

		The ships are sailing
		To Constantinople.
		Trains leave for Moscow.
		From human noise
		Or from the osprey
		Every day I feel
		Longing.

		I'm far away
		Far abandoned
		even closer
		It looks like the moon.
		Handfuls of water peas
		Splashing Black Sea
		Wave.

		Every day
		I come to the pier
		I follow everyone
		Who is not sorry
		And I look harder and harder
		And closer
		Into the enchanted distance

		Maybe from Le Havre
		Ile Marseille
		will sail
		Louise il Jeannette,
		that I remember
		hitherto,
		But which
		Not at all.

		The smell of the sea in the taste
		Smoky bitter.
		May be,
		Miss Mitchell
		Or Claude
		I will be remembered
		In NYC,
		After reading this thing translation.

		All we are looking for
		In this world of storm
		Calling us
		Invisible traces.
		Not from that
		Like lamps with lampshades
		Do jellyfish glow from the water?

		Because
		When meeting a foreigner
		I am under the creaks
		Schooner and ships
		I hear a voice
		Weeping hurdy-gurdy
		Ile distant
		The cry of the cranes.

		Isn't that her?
		Isn't she?
		Well, maybe in life
		Can you figure it out?
		If now her
		caught up
		And sped away
		Flared trousers.

		Every day
		I come to the pier
		I see everyone
		Who is not sorry
		And I look harder and harder
		And closer
		Into the enchanted distance

		And others are here
		They live differently.
		And not without reason at night
		A whistle is heard -
		This means,
		With the dexterity of a dog
		A smuggler is on his way.

		The border guard is not afraid
		Fast.
		The one he noticed will not go away
		Enemy,
		That's why so often
		A shot is heard
		On sea, salty
		Shores.

		But the enemy is alive
		No matter how you blow it
		Because it turns blue
		All Batum.
		Even the sea seems to me
		Indigo
		Under the tabloid
		Laughter and noise.

		And there is something to laugh
		Cause.
		After all, not so much
		In the world of divas.
		Walks crazy
		old man,
		Planting a rooster in the dark.

		Laughing myself
		I'm going back to the pier
		I follow everyone
		Who is not sorry
		And I look harder and harder
		And closer
		Into the enchanted distance

		1924


* * *

		Now do not scatter this sadness
		Ringing laughter of distant years.
		My white linden has faded,
		The nightingale dawn rang out.

		Everything was new to me back then.
		A lot of feelings crowded in the heart,
		And now even a tender word
		Bitter fruit breaks from the mouth.

		And the familiar spaces
		Not so good under the moon.
		Gullies ... hemp ... slopes
		They saddened the Russian expanse.

		Unhealthy, frail, low,
		Watery, gray surface.
		This is all dear and close to me,
		What makes it so easy to cry.

		rickety hut,
		Weeping sheep, and away in the wind
		The little horse waving its scrawny tail,
		Looking into the unkind pond.

		That's all we call home
		That's all why on her
		They drink and cry at the same time with bad weather,
		Looking forward to happy days.

		Therefore, no one will disperse
		This sadness is the laughter of early years.
		My white linden has faded,
		The nightingale dawn rang out.

		1924


* * *

		We are now leaving little by little
		In the country where peace and grace.
		Maybe soon I will be on my way
		To collect mortal belongings.

		Lovely birch thickets!
		You earth! And you, plains sands!
		Before this host of departing
		I can't hide my anguish.

		I loved too much in this world
		Everything that envelops the soul in flesh.
		Peace to the aspens, which, spreading its branches,
		We looked into the pink water.

		I thought many thoughts in silence ,
		I composed many songs about myself,
		And on this gloomy earth
		Happy that I breathed and lived.

		Happy that I kissed women
		Crumpled flowers, rolled on the grass
		And the beast, like our smaller brothers,
		Never hit on the head.

		I know that thickets do not bloom there,
		Rye does not ring with a swan's neck.
		That is why before the host of the departing
		I always get trembling.

		I know that in that country there will be no
		These fields, golden in the mist.
		That's why people are dear to me
		that live with me on earth.

		1924


PUSHKIN

		Dreaming of a mighty gift
		The one who became Russian fate,
		I'm standing on Tverskoy Boulevard,
		I stand and talk to myself.

		Blond, almost white
		In legends, which has become like fog,
		Oh Alexander! You were a rake
		Like I'm a bully today.

		But these darlings are for fun
		Don't darken your image
		And in bronze forged glory
		You shake your proud head.

		And I stand, as before communion,
		And I say to you:
		I would die now of happiness
		Blessed with such a fate.

		But, doomed to persecution,
		I will still sing for a long time ...
		So that my steppe singing
		Managed to ring bronze.

		1924


* * *

		Low house with blue shutters
		I will never forget you,
		Were too recent
		Resounding into the dusk of the year.

		To this day I still dream
		Our field, meadows and forest,
		Covered with gray chintz
		These northern poor skies.

		I can't admire
		And the abyss would not want to be in the wilderness,
		But, probably, forever I have
		The tenderness of the sad Russian soul.

		I fell in love with gray cranes
		With their cooing into the skinny distances,
		By the fact that in the vastness of the fields
		They did not see hearty bread.

		Just saw a birch and blossom,
		Yes broom, crooked and leafless,
		Yes, the robbers heard the whistles,
		From which it is easy to die.

		As much as I would like not to love,
		I still can't learn
		And under this cheap chintz
		You are sweet to me, dear howl.

		Because so and recent days
		Years are no longer young ...
		Low house with blue shutters
		I will never forget you.

		May 26, 1924


SON OF A BITCH

		Again floated years out of the darkness
		And they make noise like a chamomile meadow.
		I remember a dog today
		What was my youth friend.

		Today my youth has faded away,
		Like maple rotted under the windows,
		But I remembered a girl in white,
		For which there was a postman dog.

		Not everyone has a loved one
		But she was like a song to me,
		Because my notes
		Didn't take the dog out of the collar.

		She never read them
		And my handwriting was unfamiliar to her,
		But I dreamed about something for a long time
		At the viburnum behind the yellow pond.

		I suffered... I wanted an answer...
		I didn't wait ... left ... And now
		Years later... a famous poet
		Here again, at the birth gates.

		That dog died a long time ago
		But in the same suit, with a tint of blue,
		With a lively barking stunned
		I was shot by her young son.

		Mother honest! And how similar!
		The pain of the soul came up again.
		With this pain, I seem to be younger ,
		And at least write notes again.

		I'm glad to hear the song of the past,
		But don't bark! Don't bark! Don't bark!
		If you want, dog, I'll kiss you
		For awakened in the heart of May?

		Kiss, I will press my body to you
		And, as a friend, I will bring you into the house ...
		Yes, I liked the girl in white
		But now I love in blue.

		July 31, 1924


* * *

		The golden grove dissuaded
		Birch, cheerful language,
		And the cranes, sadly flying,
		No more regrets for anyone.

		Whom to pity? After all, every wanderer in the world -
		He will pass, come in, and put up the house again.
		Hemp dreams about all the departed
		With a wide moon over the blue pond.

		I stand alone among the naked plain,
		And the cranes are carried by the wind into the distance,
		I'm full of thoughts about a cheerful youth,
		But I don't regret anything in the past.

		I'm not sorry for the years wasted x in vain,
		Do not feel sorry for the soul of a lilac flower.
		In the garden, a fire of red rowan is burning,
		But he cannot warm anyone.

		Rowan brushes will not burn,
		Grass will not disappear from yellowness,
		Like a tree sheds its leaves,
		So I drop sad words.

		And if time I, sweeping away with the wind,
		Rake them all into one unnecessary lump ...
		Say so ... that the grove is golden
		She answered in a sweet way.

		1924


HOMECOMING

		I visited my native places
		That countryside
		Where did he live as a boy
		Where is the watchtower with a birch tower
		shot up.

		How much has changed there
		In their poor unsightly life.
		What a lot of discoveries
		Followed me around.

		father's house
		I could not recognize;
		A conspicuous maple is no longer waving under the window,
		And mother is not sitting on the porch ,
		Feeding the chickens grainy porridge.

		She must be getting old...
		Yes, old.
		I look around sadly.
		What an unfamiliar area for me:
		One, like the old one, the mountain turns white,

		Yes, by the mountain
		Tall gray stone.
		There's a graveyard here!
		rotten crosses,
		As if in hand-to-hand dead men,
		They stood with outstretched arms.

		Along the path, leaning on the footrest,
		There is an old man, sweeping dust from the weeds.

		"Passerby!
		Point out buddy
		Where does Yesenina Tatyana live here?

		"Tatiana... Hm...
		Yes, behind that hut .
		What are you to her?
		Akin?
		Al, maybe the son is lost?

		"Yes son.
		But what's wrong with you, old man?
		Tell me,
		Why do you look so sad?"

		"Good, my grandson,
		It's good that you didn't recognize your grandfather! .. "
		"Oh, grandfather, is it really you?"
		And a sad conversation flowed
		Tears warm on dusty flowers.
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .

		"You'll probably be thirty soon...
		And I'm ninety...
		Soon to the coffin.
		It's high time to go back,"
		He speaks, while he wrinkles his forehead.
		"Yes !.. Time!..
		Are you not a communist?
		"No!.."
		"And the sisters became members of the Komsomol.
		Such disgusting! Just choke!
		Yesterday the icons were thrown from the shelf,
		On the church, the commissioner removed the cross.
		Now there is nowhere for God to pray.
		Now I'm stealthily walking into the forest,
		I pray to aspens ...
		Might be useful...
		Go home -
		You will see for yourself."

		And we go, trampling the border of the puppetry.
		I smile at arable land and forests,
		And grandfather looks longingly at the bell tower.
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		"Hey, mother! Great!" -
		And I again pull the handkerchief to my eyes.
		Here a cow can burst into tears,
		Looking at this poor corner.

		On the wall is a calendar Lenin.
		This is the life of sisters
		Sisters, not mine -
		But still I'm ready to fall on my knees,
		Seeing you, beloved lands.

		Neighbors came...
		Woman with a child.
		Nobody will recognize me anymore.
		Byronian our little dog
		Met with barking at the gate.

		Ah, dear land!
		You are not the one
		Not the one.
		Yes, and I, of course, was not the same.
		Than mother and grandfather are sadder and more hopeless,
		The merrier the sister's mouth laughs.

		Of course, Lenin is not an icon for me,
		I know the world...
		I love my family...
		But somehow still with a bow
		I sit down on a wooden bench.

		"Well, speak, sister!"
		And here the sister breeds ,
		Having opened, like the Bible, pot-bellied "Capital",
		About Marx,
		Engels...
		Under no weather
		I haven't read these books, of course.

		And it's funny to me
		Like a smart girl
		Takes me by the collar in everything ...
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
		Byronian our little dog

Rus' SOVIET

A. Sakharov

		That hurricane has passed. Few of us survived.
		Many are not at the roll call of friendship.
		I returned to the orphaned land again,
		In which he had not been for eight years.

		Who should I call? With whom should I share
		That sad joy that I survived?
		Here even the mill is a log bird
		With a single wing, he stands with his eyes closed.

		I don't know anyone here
		And those that remember, have long since forgotten.
		And where there was once a father's house,
		Now lies ash and a layer of road dust.

		And life is in full swing.
		They scurry around me
		Both old and young faces.
		But there is no one to bow to me with a hat,
		I don't find shelter in anyone's eyes.

		And thoughts go through my head:
		What is homeland?
		Are these dreams?
		After all, for almost everyone here I am a gloomy pilgrim
		God knows how far away.

		And it's me!
		I am a village citizen
		Which will be famous only for that,
		That here once a woman gave birth
		Russian scandalous piit.

		But the voice of thought says to the heart:
		"Remember! Why are you offended?
		'Cause it's just a new light burning
		Another generation at the huts.

		Already you began to fade a little,
		Other youths sing other songs.
		They will probably be of interest to her -
		No longer a village, but the whole earth is their mother.

		Oh, motherland, how funny I have become!
		A dry blush flies on sunken cheeks.
		The language of fellow citizens has become like a stranger to me,
		In my own country, I am like a foreigner.

		Here I see:
		Sunday Villagers
		At the parish, as in a church, they gathered.
		Clumsy unwashed speeches
		They discuss their "zhis".

		It's already evening. liquid gilding
		The sunset spattered the gray fields.
		And bare feet, like heifers under the gate,
		They stuck poplars in the ditches.

		A lame Red Army soldier with a sleepy face,
		In memories wrinkle my forehead,
		Tells importantly about Budyonny,
		About how the Reds recaptured Perekop.

		"We already have it - and that way and that way, -
		Bourgeois entogo ... who ... in the Crimea ... "
		And the maples wrinkle with the ears of long branches,
		And the women groan in the silent twilight.

		From the mountain comes a peasant koms grinder,
		And to the harmonica, playing zealously,
		Poor Demyan's agitation sings,
		Cheerful cry announcing the dol.

		That's the country!
		What the hell am I
		Shouted in verse that I am friendly with the people?
		My poetry is no longer needed here
		And, perhaps, I myself am not needed here either.

		Well!
		Sorry homestay.
		What has served you - and that I am already satisfied.
		Let them not sing me today -
		I sang when my region was sick.

		I accept everything
		I accept everything as is.
		Ready to follow the beaten tracks,
		I'll give my whole soul to October and May,
		But I won't give you my sweet lyre.

		I will not give her into the wrong hands, -
		No mother, no friend, no wife.
		Only she entrusted her sounds to me
		And tender songs only sang to me.

		Blossom, young, and healthy body!
		You have a different life. You have another one for singing.
		And I will go alone to unknown limits,
		Rebellious soul forever subdued.

		But even then,
		When all over the planet
		The tribal feud will pass,
		Lies and sadness will disappear -
		I will chant
		With the whole being in the poet
		sixth of the earth
		With the short name m "Rus".

BALLAD OF THE TWENTY-SIX

With love -

great artist

G. Yakulov

		Sing a song, poet
		Sing.
		Such a chintz of the sky
		Blue.
		The sea also roars
		Song.
		There were
		26.
		26 of them were
		26.
		Their graves to the sands
		Do not bring.
		Nobody will forget
		Their execution
		On the 207th
		Verst.

		There he walks across the sea
		Fog.
		You see, rose from the sand
		Shaumyan.
		Over the desert bony
		Knock.
		Won 50 more
		Hand
		Come out, erasing
		Mold.
		26 of them were
		26.
		Who with a shot in the chest,
		Who is on the side
		They say:
		"It's time for us to go to Baku -
		We will see,
		As long as there is fog
		How does he live
		Azerbaijan".

		. . . . . . . . . . . . .
		. . . . . . . . . . . . .

		Night like a melon
		Rolls the moon.
		Sea to shore
		Throws a wave.
		That same night
		And fog
		dispersed them
		English squad.

		Communism -
		The banner of all freedoms.
		Boiled like a hurricane
		People.
		Embarked on an empire
		In a row
		And the peasant
		And the proletariat.
		There, in Russia,
		Noble scourge
		Our father was strict
		Ilyich.
		And in the East
		Here
		There were
		26.

		Everyone remembers, of course,
		That,
		18th, unfortunate
		Year.
		Then the bourgeois
		All countries
		shelled
		Azerbaijan.

		It was hard for the Commune
		Hit.
		Couldn't bear this edge
		And fell
		But it was scarier
		News
		Hear
		About 26.

		In the sands that are like melted
		Wax,
		They brought them
		For Krasnovodsk,
		And who is the saber
		Who is a bullet in the side -
		All stacked on yellow
		Sand.

		26 of them were
		26.
		Their graves to the sands
		Do not bring.
		Nobody will forget
		Their execution
		On the 207th
		Verst.

		There he walks across the sea

		You see, rose from the sand
		Shaumyan.
		Over the desert bony
		Knock.
		Won 50 more
		Hand
		Come out, erasing
		Mold.
		26 of them were
		26.

		. . . . . . . . . . . . .

		Night feels like today
		Pale.
		Over Baku
		26 shadows.
		These shadows
		26.
		About them our pain
		And a song.

		It's not the wind that makes noise
		Not fog.
		Hear what he says
		Shaumyan:
		"Japaridze!
		Am I blind?
		Look:
		The workers have bread.
		Oil is black
		The blood of the earth.
		Locomotives all around...
		Ships...
		And all the ships
		To the trains
		Our red one is beaten

		Japaridze in response:

		Sing, poet, a song,
		sing
		Such a chintz of the sky
		Blue.
		The sea also roars
		Song -
		26 of them were

STANS

Dedicated to P. Chagin

		I'm talking about my talent
		I know a lot.
		Poems are not very difficult things.
		But most of all
		Love for the native land
		tormented me,
		Tormented and burned.

		write a poem,
		Perhaps everyone can
		About the girl, about the stars, about the moon...
		But I have a different feeling
		The heart is gnawing
		Other thoughts
		They give me a skull.

		I want to be a singer
		And a citizen
		So that everyone
		As pride and example
		Was real
		Not a step-son
		In the great states of the USSR.

		I ran away from Moscow for a long time:
		I get along with the police
		Not in a knack
		For all my beer scandal
		They kept me
		In tigulevka.

		Thank you for the friendship of these citizens,
		But very tough
		Sleep there on the bench
		And in a drunken voice
		Read some verse
		Oh to summer fate
		The unfortunate canary.

		I am not a canary!
		I am a poet!
		And not like some Demyan.
		Let me be drunk sometimes
		But in my eyes
		Insights wondrous light.

		I see everything.
		And I clearly understand
		That the new era
		Not a pound of raisins for us
		What is the name of Lenin
		Noisy, like the wind on the edge,
		Giving thought a go
		Like mill wings.

		Turn around, darlings!
		A promise is promised to you.
		I am your nephew
		You are all my uncles.
		Come on Sergey
		We will quietly sit down for Marx,
		Smell the wisdom
		Boring lines.

		Days run like streams
		Into the misty river
		Cities are fading
		Like letters on paper.
		Recently I was in Moscow
		And now here in Baku.
		In the element of crafts
		Chagin initiates us.

		"Look," he says,
		Isn't it better than churches
		Here are the towers
		Chernykh oil-fountains .
		Enough of mystical mists.
		Sing, poet
		What is stronger and more alive.

		Oil on water
		Like a Persian blanket
		And evening across the sky
		Scattered the stellar sack.
		But I'm ready to swear
		pure heart,
		What lights
		More beautiful than the stars in Baku.

		I have a lot of thoughts about industrial power,
		I hear the voice of human forces.
		Enough with us
		All heavenly luminaries,
		Us on earth
		It's easier to set up.

		And, himself
		Stroking on the neck
		I speak:
		"Our time has come,
		Come on Sergey
		We will quietly sit down for Marx,
		To unravel
		The wisdom of boring lines.

		1924


Rus' OUTGOING

		We don't know much yet
		Pets of Lenin's victory,
		And new songs
		Let's eat the old way
		As our grandparents taught us.

		Friends! Friends!
		What a split in the country
		What sadness in the boiling weight of ate!
		Know that's why I want so much
		Pull up your pants
		Run after the Komsomol.

		I do not blame those who leave in sadness,
		Well, where are the old people
		Chasing young men?
		They are uncompressed rye in the vine
		Left to rot and crumble.

		And me, myself
		Not young, not old
		Doomed to manure for time.
		Is it because the tavern ringing of the guitar
		Am I having a sweet dream?

		guitar cute,
		Call, call!
		Play, gypsy, something like that
		So that I forget the poisoned days
		Knowing neither affection nor peace.

		I blame the Soviet government
		And that's why I'm mad at her
		That my youth is bright
		I did not see others in the fight.

		What did I see?
		I only saw the fight
		Yes instead of songs
		Heard cannonade.
		Is it because with a yellow head
		I ran around the planet until I drop?

		But still I'm happy.
		In the host of storms
		I made inimitable impressions.
		The whirlwind dressed up my fate
		In golden bloom.

		I'm not new!
		What to hide?
		I stayed in the past with one foot,
		In an effort to catch up with the steel army,
		I slide and fall another.

		But there are other people .
		Those
		Even more unhappy and forgotten
		They are like bran in a sieve
		Among the events they do not understand.

		I know them
		And looked:
		Eyes sadder than a cow's.
		Among human peaceful affairs,
		Like a pond, their blood is moldy.

		Who will throw a stone into this pond?
		Don't touch!
		There will be a musty smell.
		They will die in themselves
		They rot with leaf fall.

		And there are other people
		Those who believe
		That pull a timid look into the future.
		Scratching back and front
		They talk about a new life.

		I'm listening to. I look in memory
		What does the peasant gossip about:
		"With the Soviet government, we live according to our guts ...
		Now chintz... Yes, a few nails..."

		How little these bradachs need,
		Whose life is in continuous
		Potatoes and bread.
		Why do I swear at night
		On an unsuccessful bitter lot?

		I envy that
		Who spent his life in battle
		Who defended a great idea.
		And I, who ruined my youth,
		I don't even have a memory.

		What a scandal!
		What a big scandal!
		I found myself in a narrow gap.
		'Cause I could give
		Not what he gave
		What was given to me as a joke.

		guitar cute,
		Call, call!
		Play, gypsy, something like that
		So that I forget the poisoned days
		Knowing neither affection nor peace.

		I know sadness cannot be drowned in wine,
		Can't heal souls
		Desert and breakaway.
		To know, that's why I want so much ,
		Pull up your pants
		Run after the Komsomol.

Rus' HOMELESS

		Comrades, today I am in grief,
		Woke up the pain
		In the faded brawler!
		I remembered
		Sad story -
		The story of Oliver Twist.

		We are all different
		by her fate.
		Who knew the fortress
		Who knows Siberia?
		Know because now
		Priests and deacons
		Pray for health
		All members of the Council of People's Commissars.

		And so the peasant
		With vodka damask,
		Telling your relatives
		Looking at Marx
		Like hosts,
		Letting Lenin
		In the eyes of tobacco smoke.

		The Irony of Fate!
		We are all wary.
		Over the old firmly
		A strong stake is inserted.
		But still we have
		Monastic communities
		With "amen" they put
		every protocol.

		And they say
		Forgetting about dangerous days:
		"How do we...
		Not to fluff, but straight to dust ...
		Fifteen pieces myself
		Killed the Reds
		Yes, so many each
		Every one of our monks.

		Mother Russia!
		I'm sorry,
		Sorry!
		But this savagery, vile and evil,
		I'm on my short journey
		I won't take a liking
		And I won't kiss.

		They have a home
		They have bread
		They are with prayers
		And blessed and full.
		But there is on this
		sad earth,
		That all the good
		And the evil ones are forgotten.

		Boys seven or eight years old
		They scurry among the states without a prize,
		Incorporeal gnarled bones
		They are a sign to us
		Heavy reproach.

		Comrades, today I am in grief,
		The pain woke up in the extinguished brawler.
		I remembered
		Sad story -
		The story of Oliver Twist.

		I grew up too
		Unhappy and thin
		Among the liquid
		Painful dawns.
		But if everyone stood up
		Boys in a row
		That would be thousands
		The finest poets.

		They have Pushkin
		Lermontov,
		Koltsov,
		And our Nekrasov in them,
		I am in them
		They even have Trotsky
		Lenin and Bukharin.
		Is it because my sadness
		The verse blows
		Looking at them
		Unwashed hari.

		I know the future...
		It's theirs...
		Their calendar...
		And all earthly glory.
		Isn't that why
		My bitter, violent verse
		For all others -
		Like a deadly poison.

		I only sing to them
		Sleeping in cauldrons
		I sing for them
		Who sometimes sleeps in the toilet.
		Oh let them
		Although they would read in verse,
		What is there for them
		Offended in the world.

LETTER TO A WOMAN

		Do you remember,
		Of course, you remember everything
		How I stood
		Approaching the wall
		You excitedly walked around the room
		And something sharp
		They threw it in my face.

		You said :
		It's time for us to part
		What tormented you
		My crazy life
		That it's time for you to get down to business,
		And my lot is
		Roll on, down.

		Darling!
		You didn't love me.
		You did not know that in the host of people
		I was like a horse driven in soap,
		Pinned by a brave rider.

		You didn't know
		That I'm in solid smoke
		In a life torn apart by a storm
		That's why I suffer that I do not understand -
		Where the rock of events takes us.

		Face to face
		Can't see faces.
		Big things are seen from a distance.
		When the sea surface boils,
		The ship is in a sorry state.

		Earth is a ship!
		But suddenly someone
		For new life, new glory
		In the midst of storms and blizzards
		He directed it majestically.

		Well, which of us is big on deck
		Didn't fall, vomit, or swear?
		They are few, with an experienced soul,
		Who remained strong in pitching.

		Then I too
		Under the wild noise
		Immaturely knowing the work,
		Went down into the ship's hold,
		To avoid watching human vomit.

		That hold was -
		Russian kabak.
		And I bent over the glass
		So that, without suffering for anyone,
		Seb I ruin
		In a frenzy drunk.

		Darling!
		I tortured you
		you had longing
		In the eyes of the weary
		What am I showing to you
		He wasted himself in scandals.

		But you didn't know
		What's in the smoke
		In a life torn apart by a storm
		That's why I suffer
		What I don't understand
		Where the rock of events takes us...
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		Now the years have passed
		I'm at a different age.
		I feel and think differently.
		And I say over the festive wine:
		Praise and glory to the helmsman!

		Today I
		In the midst of tender feelings.
		I remembered your sad fatigue.
		And now
		I'm rushing to let you know
		What was I
		And what happened to me!

		Darling!
		Nice to say to me:
		I avoided falling off the cliff.
		Now in the Soviet side
		I am the most furious fellow traveler.

		I became not the one
		Who was then.
		I wouldn't torment you
		As it was before.
		For the banner of liberty
		And bright work
		Ready to go even to the Channel.

		Forgive me...
		I know you are not the one
		Do you live
		With a serious, intelligent husband;
		That you don't need our maeta,
		And I myself to you
		a bit of a pelt.

		Live like this
		How the star guides you
		Under the tabernacle of the renewed canopy.
		Greetings,
		always remembering you
		Your friend
		Sergey Yesenin.

		But the poets did not quarrel.

		Testifies
		Prophetic sign:
		Poet to poet
		There is a kunak.

		Autocratic

		Succumbing to feelings
		Human...

		The marvelous
		Rock of Destiny:
		Already we are more
		Not slaves.

		Good oh, good hour! ..

		Like a noisy Kura,
		I love in feasts and in conversations.

LETTER FROM THE MOTHER

		What do I
		Now come up with
		About what now
		Should I write more?
		In front of me
		On the table gloomily
		Lies a letter
		What my mother sent me.

		She writes to me:
		"If you can
		Then come, my dear,
		To us for the holidays.
		Buy me a shawl
		Buy ports for your father
		In our house
		Big flaws.

		I don't like fear
		What are you a poet
		What did you make friends
		With bad fame.
		Much better b
		From an early age
		You went to the field for a plow.

		I have become old
		And really bad
		But if at home
		You were from the beginning
		That's what I have
		Now it would be a daughter-in-law
		And on the leg
		I rocked my granddaughter.

		But you are children
		Lost in the world
		his wife
		Easily given to another
		And without family, without friendship,
		No berth
		you with your head
		He went to the tavern pool.

		My beloved son
		What happened to you?
		You were so meek
		You were so humble.
		And they all said:
		What a happy
		Alexander Yesenin!

		You are our hopes
		Didn't come true
		And in the soul
		Since then it hurts more and more bitterly
		What's with the father
		It was a vain thought
		So that for poetry
		You took more money.

		At least how much would you
		I didn't take
		You won't send them home
		And that's why it's so sad
		Words are pouring
		What do I know
		From your experience:
		Poets don't get paid.

		I don't like fear
		What are you a poet
		What did you make friends
		With bad fame.
		Much better b
		From an early age
		You went to the field for a plow.

		Now sheer sadness
		live in darkness.
		We don't have a horse.
		But if you were in the house
		That would be everything
		And with your mind
		Post of chairman
		In the executive committee.

		Then life would be bolder
		No one would pull us
		And you wouldn't know
		Unnecessary fatigue.
		I would force
		Spin _
		your wife
		And you are like a son
		Reposed our old age.
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		I crumple the letter
		I'm sinking into horror.
		Is there really no way out
		In my cherished path?
		But all I think
		I'll tell you later.
		I will tell
		In a reply letter...

		19 24


ANSWER

		Dear old lady
		Live how you live.
		I feel tenderly
		Your love and memory.
		But only you
		You won't understand a bit
		What do I live
		And what am I doing in the world.

		Now you have winter
		And moonlit nights
		I know you
		Don't think alone
		As if who
		Bird cherry shakes
		And showers
		Snow at the window.

		Darling!
		Well, how to fall asleep in a blizzard?
		In the pipe so plaintively
		And moans so long.
		Would you like to lie down
		But you don't see the bed
		A narrow coffin
		And - that you are buried.

		Like a thousand
		The most vile devils ,
		She sings in plakida -
		Bastard-blizzard!
		And the snow falls
		Like piglets
		And no beyond the coffin
		No wife, no friend!

		I am the most
		I love spring.
		love spill
		swift stream,
		Where every chip
		Like a ship
		Such space
		What you can't see.

		But that spring
		I love
		I am the great revolution
		I call!
		And only about her
		I suffer and mourn
		Her one
		I'm waiting and calling!

		But this wickedness
		Cold planet!
		Her and three hundred suns
		Until melted!
		That's why
		With the sick soul of a poet
		I went to make a fuss
		To be naughty and drink.

		But there will be time
		Dear, dear!
		She will come, the desired time!
		No wonder we
		Crouched by the guns:
		He sat by the gun
		This one is by the pen.

		Forget about money you
		Forget everything.
		What death?!
		Is it you , is it you?
		After all, I'm not a cow,
		Not a horse, not a donkey,
		To me
		Taken out of the stall!

		I'll go out myself
		When the time comes
		When to shoot
		Will have to on the planet.
		And turning back
		I'll buy you a scarf
		Well, father
		I will buy these things.

		In the meantime, a blizzard is coming .
		And a thousand deacons
		She sings in plakida -
		Bastard-blizzard.
		And the snow falls
		Like piglets
		And no beyond the coffin
		No wife, no friend.

LETTER TO GRANDFATHER

		I left
		Native home.
		Dear! Grandfather!
		I am writing to you again.
		under your windows
		Now the blizzards are whistling
		And in the chimney
		A long howl and noise

		Like a hundred devils
		Climbed into the attic.
		And you don't sleep all night
		And kick your feet.
		And you want
		Throwing on your jacket
		Go there,
		Beat everyone with a poker.

		Naivety dear
		Untouched soul!
		No wonder great-grandfather
		For oats three measures
		I took you to the deacon
		In the abandoned wilderness
		Teach: "It is worthy to eat"
		And with "Father" "Creed".

		A good horse is grazing.
		Selected feed
		He is a guarantee of love.
		And, himself
		Called to judgment
		To the same
		You taught your grandson.

		But the grandson of this study
		Didn't get it.
		And, to your bitterness,
		Went to a foreign country.
		Do you think now
		I wander as a vagabond
		Compiling in thoughts
		Unnecessary stupid verse.

		You say,
		What was stolen from you
		That I'm a fool
		And the city is a rogue and a spendthrift.
		But only, grandfather,
		Hardly, hardly

		bad horse
		The thief will not take away.
		bad horse
		You can't get out of the yard
		But whoever wants
		Know another surface
		He will say:
		So as not to rot in the backwater,
		native country
		Need to leave .

		Here I threw it.
		I am in a distant country.
		Spring.
		Here the roses are bigger than a fist.
		And I am yours
		The fate of the lonely
		Hello them warm
		I ship from afar.

		Now the blizzard
		With might and main whistles in Ryazan.
		And you
		See me itching.
		But you know
		No sled
		you here
		They won't take me.

		I know -
		Would you come to the roses
		To warmth.
		Yes, but here's the problem:
		your curse
		The power of a locomotive
		forever you
		It won't move anywhere.

		What if I die?
		Do you hear, grandfather?
		Will I die?
		You sit or not in the car,
		What to attend
		At the wedding funeral
		And sing at the last
		Sorrow me hallelujah?

		Then sit down, old man.
		Sit down without tears
		trust you
		Steel mare.
		Oh what a horse
		What a horse locomotive!
		Her, probably
		Bought in Germany.

		Her cast-iron mouth
		Get used to the fire
		And the smoke above her, like a mane, -
		Black, thick and clear.
		Such a mane
		To our horse
		How much would it be
		Different mops and brushes!

		I know -
		Time even crushes a stone.
		And you, old man
		Someday you'll understand
		What even the best
		Harnessing a horse to a sleigh
		To a distant land
		Just bring the bones.

		You will also understand
		That I left for nothing
		Where the run
		Faster than flying.
		In a country engulfed in a blizzard
		And the fire
		bad horse
		The thief will not take away.

BLIZZARD

		Spin , days, your former yarn,
		A living soul cannot be rebuilt forever.
		No!
		I will never get along with myself
		To yourself, beloved,
		I am a stranger.

		I want to read, but the book falls out,
		Filled with yawns
		So it goes to sleep...
		And outside the window
		The lingering wind howls,
		As if I can feel
		The proximity of the funeral.

		shabby maple
		With its black top
		Gnusavit hoarsely
		In the sky about the past.
		What kind of maple is he?
		He's just a shameful pillar -
		On it to hang
		Or give it up for scrap.

		And the first
		I need to hang
		Crossing my arms behind my back
		For the fact that the song
		hoarse and sick
		I interfered with sleep
		Native country.

		I do not like
		Rooster chants
		And I say
		What if he was strong
		That would be for all the roosters
		I tore out the offal
		That they
		They didn't vote at night.

		But I forgot
		That I myself am a rooster
		Oh ral with might and main
		Before the dawn of the edge,
		Trampling father's covenants,
		Worried by the heart
		And in verse.

		The blizzard screeches
		Like a boar
		Who were about to be killed.
		Cold,
		ice mist,
		You won't understand
		Where is the distance
		Where near...

		The moon, probably
		with obaki -
		Its been long
		Can't be seen in the sky.
		Pulling the thread from the tow,
		With spindle
		The mother is talking.

		deaf cat
		Heeds that conversation
		Hanging from the couch
		important chapter.
		No wonder they say
		shy neighbors,
		What does he look like
		For a black owl.

		Eyes close,
		And how do I screw them up?
		I see it for real
		From fairy tales:
		cat paw me
		Shows the muzzle
		And mother is like a witch
		From the Kyiv mountain.

		I don't know if I'm sick
		Or not sick
		But only thoughts
		They roam randomly.
		In the ears of the grave
		of a shovel
		With a distant sob
		Belfry.

		Himself Deceased
		I see in the coffin.
		Under the alleluia
		The lamentations of the deacon
		I am forever dead to myself
		I go lower
		Laying on them
		Two copper patches.

		With this money
		From dead eyes
		The gravedigger will be warmer, -
		me for the tear,
		He is the same hour
		He will leave himself with a fistula.

		And say out loud:
		"Here's a freak!
		He is in life
		Rumbled a lot...
		But I couldn't overcome
		five pages
		From Capital.

		December 1924


SPRING

		The attack is over.
		Sadness in disgrace.
		I accept life as the first dream.
		Yesterday I read in Capital,
		What is for poets -
		Your law.

		Blizzard now
		At least damn howl
		Knock drowned naked
		I'm with a sober head
		Comrade cheerful and cheerful.

		Rotten we have nothing to regret,
		Yes, and I do not need to feel sorry,
		Kohl could meekly die
		I'm in this blizzard.

		Tin-tin, tit!
		Good afternoon
		Don't be afraid!
		I won't touch you.
		And whatever
		On the wattle fence
		Sit down according to the bird's law.

		There is a law of rotation in the world,
		He is attitude
		among the living.
		If you are with the people of a single bush,
		Have right
		Lie down and sit down.

		Hello to you,
		My poor maple!
		I'm sorry I offended you.
		Your clothes are torn
		But you will
		Endowed with a new one.

		April without a warrant
		Let go of the green hat
		And quiet
		Into a gentle bundle
		The attendant will hug you.

		And a girl will come to you
		Water will pour from the well,
		To in harsh October
		You could fight blizzards.

		And at night
		The moon will come up.
		The dogs didn't eat it.
		She was just invisible.
		Because of the human
		Bloody fight.

		But the fight is over...
		And so -
		She with her lemon light
		Trees dressed in greenery,
		Sonorous radiance
		Will fly.

		So drink, my breast,
		Spring!
		Get excited new
		Poetry!
		Today I'm going to sleep
		I won't quarrel
		With roosters.

		Earth, earth!
		You are not metal.
		Metal after all
		Doesn't bud.
		Enough to hit
		per line
		And suddenly -
		Understand Capital.

Poems of 1925



* * *

		Blue May. A glowing warmth.
		The ring at the gate will not ring.
		Wormwood has a sticky smell.
		Sleeping bird cherry in a white cape.

		In the wooden wings of the window
		Together with frames in thin curtains
		The eccentric moon knits
		Lace patterns on the floor.

		Our chamber, though small,
		But clean. I am with me at my leisure ...
		This evening, my whole life is dear to me,
		What a nice memory of a friend.

		The garden will blaze like a foamy fire,
		And the moon, straining all the forces,
		Wants everyone to tremble
		From the nagging word "darling."

		Only I am in this flower, in this expanse,
		Under the talyanka of a merry May,
		I can't wish for anything
		Everything as it is, endlessly accepting.

		I accept - come and appear,
		All appear, in which there is pain and joy ...
		Peace be upon you, noisy life.
		Peace be with you, blue cool.

		1925


DOG KACHALOV

		Give me a paw, Jim, for good luck,
		I have never seen such a paw.
		Let's eat with you in the moonlight
		For quiet, quiet weather.
		Give me a paw, Jim, for luck.

		Please, darling, don't lick.
		Understand with me at least the simplest.
		'Cause you don't know what life is
		You don't know what it's worth to live in the world.

		Your master is both sweet and famous ,
		And he has many guests in the house,
		And everyone, smiling, strives
		To touch you on velvet wool.

		You are devilishly beautiful like a dog,
		With such a sweet trusting friend.
		And without asking anyone,
		Like a drunken friend, you climb to kiss me.

		My dear Jim, among your guests
		There were so many different and different ones.
		But the one that is all silent and sadder,
		Did you come here by any chance?

		She will come, I promise you.
		And without me, in her staring gaze,
		You gently lick her hand for me
		For everything in which he was and was not guilty.

		1925


* * *

		Inexpressible, blue, tender...
		My land is quiet after storms, after thunderstorms,
		And my soul is a boundless field -
		Breathes the scent of honey and roses.

		I calmed down. The years have taken their toll
		But what has passed, I do not curse.
		Like a trio of frenzied horses
		Rolled all over the country.

		Sprayed around. Have accumulated.
		And disappeared under the devil's whistle.
		And now here in the forest monastery
		You can even hear the leaf falling.

		Is it a bell? Far echo?
		Everyone calmly sucks in the chest.
		Stop, darling , we drove with you
		Through a stormy path.

		Let's take a look at everything we've seen
		What happened, what happened in the country,
		And forgive where we were bitterly offended
		Through someone else's fault and ours.

		I accept what was and wasn't.
		Only a pity in the thirtieth year -
		I demanded too little in my youth,
		Forgetting in the tavern haze.

		But the oak is young, not getting sick,
		It bends just like grass in a field ...
		Oh you, youth, violent youth,
		Golden daredevil!

		1925


SONG

		There is one good song for the solo vushka -
		The song is a dirge for my little head.

		Blossomed - tambourine, grew - knife,
		And now suddenly hung down, as if inanimate.

		My thoughts, my thoughts! Pain in temples and vertex.
		I squandered my youth without pores, without time.

		How it happened, I don't understand myself .
		At night I press a hard pillow to my heart.

		Leisya, sonorous song, pour out a dull trill.
		In the dark, it seems to me - I hug my dear.

		Outside the window, the harmonica and the radiance of the moon.
		I only know that my dear will never meet.

		Eh, love is Kalinushka, blood is a cherry dawn,
		Like an old guitar and like a new song.

		With the same smiles, joy and anguish,
		What was sung by grandfathers is sung by grandchildren.

		Drink, sing in youth, hit life without a miss -
		All the same, the beloved will bloom with bird cherry.

		I bloomed, I don't know where. In drunkenness , or what? Is it in glory?
		I liked it when I was young, but now I've left it.

		Because the nightingale has a good song,
		The song is a dirge for my little head.

		Blossomed - tambourine, was - knife,
		And now suddenly hung down, as if inanimate.

		1925


* * *

		Well, kiss me, kiss me,
		Whether it's blood or pain.
		Out of tune with the cold will
		Boiling water of heart jets.

		overturned mug
		Among the merry is not for us.
		Understand my friend
		On earth they live only once!

		Look around with calm eyes
		Look: in the mist with yra
		The moon is like a yellow raven
		Circling, hovering above the ground.

		Well, kiss me! So I want.
		The song of decay sang to me.
		It can be seen that he sensed my death
		The one who climbs in the sky.

		Withering power!
		To die is to die!
		Until the end of my dear lips
		I would like to kiss.

		So that all the time in blue dreams,
		Not ashamed and not melting,
		In the gentle rustle of bird cherry
		It was heard: "I am yours."

		And so that the light over a full mug
		Not extinguished with light foam -
		Drink and sing, my friend:
		On earth they live only once!

		1925


1ST OF MAY

		There is m music, poems and dances,
		There are lies and flattery...
		Let me be scolded for stanzas -
		They have truth.

		I saw a holiday, a holiday of May -
		And amazed.
		I was ready to bend, hugging
		All virgins and wives.

		Where will you go, who will you tell
		On someone's "henna"
		What in solar yarn bathed
		Balakhani?

		Well, how can you not carve a hymn in your heart,
		Do not fall into a shiver?
		Walked, sang forty thousand
		And they drank too.

		Poetry! poetry! Not very left!
		I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
		We drank to the health of oil
		And for the guests.

		uplifting my first side ,
		With one nod
		I drank on this May holiday
		For the Council of People's Commissars.

		The second glass, so, not very
		Lie down in the rubber
		I drank proudly for the workers
		Under someone's speech.

		And I drank my third glass,
		Like some khan
		For not bending in a wheeze
		The fate of the peasants

		Drink, heart! Just don't point blank
		To destroy life ...
		That's why I drank the fourth
		Only for myself.

		1925


LETTER TO SISTER

		Our Alexander wrote about Delvig,
		He caressed about the skull
		Strings.
		So beautiful and so far away
		But still close
		What a blooming garden!

		Hello Sister!
		Hi Hi!
		Am I a peasant or not?
		Well, how is grandfather now caring
		For cherries here, in Ryazan?

		Ah, those cherries!
		Have you forgotten them?
		And how much trouble did my father have,
		So that our skinny
		And a red mare
		She pulled out a root crop with a plow.

		Father needs potatoes.
		We needed a garden.
		And the garden was destroyed
		Yes, they did, darling!
		Wet pillow knows about it
		A little... Seven...
		Or eight years ago.

		I remember the holiday
		Sound holiday of May.
		blossoms ,
		Lilac bloomed.
		And, hugging each birch,
		I was drunk
		Than a blue day

		Birches!
		Birch girls!
		Only he can not love them,
		Who even in an affectionate teenager
		The fetus cannot be predicted.

		Sister! Sister!
		Friends are so few in life oh!
		Like everyone else
		I have a seal...
		If your heart is tender
		Wearily,
		Make him forget and shut up.

		You know Sasha.
		Sasha was good.
		and Lermontov
		Sasha was on the shoulder.
		But I'm sick...
		Lilac Powder
		Now just only
		I'll heal my soul.

		I feel sorry for you.
		Stay alone
		And I'm ready to go
		Even before the duel.
		"Blessed is he who has not drunk to the bottom" [2 - Pushkin's words (Note by S. Yesenin).]
		And did not listen to the voice of the flute.

		But our garden!
		Garden...
		After all, and on it in the spring
		Your
		Cursed children.
		ABOUT!
		Let them
		Will be remembered inappropriately
		What lived...

		Freaks in the world.

		1925


* * *

		Dawn calls out to another
		The oatmeal surface is smoking...
		I remembered you dear
		My decrepit mother.

		As before walking on a hillock,
		Clutching your crutch in your hand,
		You see otrish on the moon bunker,
		Floating on a sleepy river.

		And you think bitterly, I know
		With great anxiety and sadness,
		That your son is on his father's side
		Doesn't hurt at all.

		Then you go to the churchyard
		And, staring at the stone point-blank,
		You sigh so gently and simply
		For my brothers and sisters.

		Let us grow knife
		And the sisters grew like May,
		You are still alive
		Don't get sad.

		Enough to mourn! Enough!
		And it's time for you to look
		That the apple tree hurts too
		Lose their copper leaves.

		Cause joy is rare
		Like a spring link in the morning,
		And to me - than to rot on the branches -
		It's better to burn in the wind.

		1925


* * *

		Uncomfortable liquid moonlight
		And the longing of the endless plains -
		This is what I saw in my frisky youth,
		That, loving, cursed more than one.

		Dried willows along the roads
		And the cart song of the wheels ...
		I wouldn't want to now,
		For me to listen to her.

		I became indifferent to shacks,
		And hearth fire is not nice to me.
		Even apple trees spring blizzard
		I fell out of love for the poverty of the fields.

		Now I like it differently...
		And in the consumptive moonlight
		Through stone and steel
		I see the power of my native side.

		Field Russia! Enough
		Drag along the fields!
		It hurts to see your poverty
		And birches and poplars.

		I don't know what will happen to me...
		Maybe I'm not fit for a new life,
		But still I want steel
		To see poor, impoverished Rus'.

		And, listening to the engine bark
		In the host of blizzards, in the host of storms and thunderstorms,
		No way now I don't want
		Listen to the song of cartwheels.

		1925


* * *

		Farewell Baku! I won't see you.
		Now there is sorrow in the soul, now there is fear in the soul.
		And the heart at hand is now more painful and closer,
		And I feel stronger than a simple word: friend.

		Farewell Baku! Blue Turkic, farewell!
		Blood cools, strength weakens.
		But I will carry, like happiness, to the grave
		And the waves of the Caspian Sea, and Balakhani May.

		Farewell Baku! Farewell, like a simple song!
		For the last time, I will hug a friend ...
		So that his head is like a golden rose,
		She nodded gently to me in lilac smoke.

		May 1925

		I'm going through the valley. On the back of the cap,
		In a kid glove, a swarthy hand.
		Pink steppes shine far away,
		The quiet river is wide blue.

		I am a carefree guy. Do not need anything.
		Just listen to songs - sing along with your heart,
		If only a slight coolness would flow,
		If only the young would not bend.

		I'll go out of the way, go out under the slopes -
		How many smart men and women are there!
		A rake whispers something, scythes whistle something ...
		"Hey, poet, listen, are you weak or not weak?

		It's nicer on earth. Fully swim in the sky.
		As you love the valleys, so would you love labor.
		Are you a villager, were you not a peasant?
		Swing your scythe, show your ardor.

		Ah, the pen is not a rake, ah, the scythe is not a pen,-
		But oblique output lines at least where.
		Under the spring sun, under the spring cloud
		People read them all year round.

		To hell, I'm taking off my English suit.
		Well, give me a scythe, I'll show you -
		Am I not your own, am I not close to you,
		Do I not value the memory of the village?

		I don't care about pits, I don't care about bumps.
		Good scythe in the morning mist
		Draw grass lines along the valleys,
		To be read by horse and bara n.

		In these lines there is a song, in these lines there is a word.
		That's why I'm glad in my thoughts about anyone,
		That every cow can read them,
		Paying with warm milk.

		July 18, 1925


* * *

		I remember, love, I remember
		The shine of your hair...
		Not joyful and not easy about me
		I had to leave you.

		I remember autumn nights
		Birch rustle of shadows...
		Let the days be shorter then
		The moon shone brighter for us.

		I remember you told me:
		"The blue years will pass,
		And you will forget, my dear,
		With another me forever.

		Linden blossom today
		Reminded feelings again
		How gently then I poured
		Flowers on a curly strand.

		And the heart, not ready to cool down
		And sadly loving another
		Like a favorite story
		On the other hand, he remembers you.

		1925


* * *

		Quiet wind. The evening is not gloomy.
		I look with wide eyes.
		In Persia, the chickens are exactly the same,
		Like we have in thatched Ryazan.

		The same month, only a little wider,
		Slightly yellower on the other side.
		We love you in this world
		It's the same for everyone, dear.

		The nights are warm - I'm not in the will, I'm not able,
		I can not praise, not sing them.
		Also, the girls here hug the cute ones.
		To the second to the roosters, to the third.

		Ah, love! She's familiar to everyone
		Even cats know this feeling
		Only me with a homeland and without a home
		From her I collect modestly crumbs.

		There is no happiness. But I won't grieve
		Everywhere there are chickens dear to the heart,
		For me scattered everywhere
		Young sensual fools.

		With them I accept all joys
		And for them I only say in verse:
		Because, to know, people love the earth,
		That she smelled of roosters.

		1925


* * *

		A sea of sparrow voices.
		Night, but it seems clear.
		So it's always great.
		Night, but it seems clear
		And on the lips of the innocent
		A sea of sparrow voices.

		Ah, the moon is like that -
		Shines - at least throw yourself into the water.
		I don't want pok
		In this blue weather.
		Ah, the moon is like that -
		Shines - at least throw yourself into the water.

		Honey, are you? is it?
		These lips are not tired.
		These mouths, as in jets,
		Life is quenched in kisses.
		Honey, are you? is it?
		Did the roses whisper to me?

		I myself do not know what will happen.
		Close, maybe somewhere
		A cheerful flute is crying.
		In the quiet evening buzz
		I love the lilies of the breast.
		A merry flute is crying,
		I myself do not know what will happen.

		1925


* * *

		I see a dream. The road is black.
		White horse. The foot is stubborn.
		And on this horse
		Comes dear to me.
		Rides, rides darling
		Only unloved.

		Oh, Russian birch!
		The path is narrow.
		This sweet as a dream
		Only for the one in love
		Hold you branches
		Like sharp hands.

		The moon shines. Blue and sleepy.
		The horse is hoofing well.
		The light is so mysterious
		As if for the only one
		The one in which the same light
		And which is not in the world.

		I'm a bully, a bully.
		From poetry fool and drunk.
		But still for this agility,
		To keep your heart warm,
		For birch Rus'
		I will make peace with the unloved.

		July 19 25


* * *

		The feather grass is sleeping. Dear plain,
		And the lead freshness of wormwood.
		No other homeland
		Do not pour my warmth into my chest.

		Know that we all have such a fate,
		And, perhaps, ask everyone -
		Rejoicing, raging and tormented,
		Is it good to live in Russia?

		The light of the moon, mysterious and long,
		Willows are crying, poplars are whispering.
		But no one under the cry of a crane
		He will not stop loving his father's fields.

		And now that behold the new light
		And my life touched fate,
		I still remain a poet
		Golden log cabin .

		At night, clinging to the headboard,
		I see a strong enemy
		How someone else's youth splashes with new
		To my glades and meadows.

		But still, cramped by the new,
		I can sing heartily:
		Give me in the homeland of my beloved,
		All loving, die in peace!

		July 1925


* * *

		I will not return to my father's house,
		The ever wandering wanderer.
		About the departed over the pond
		Let the hemp grower grieve.

		Let uneven meadows
		They sing about me with nettles, -
		The arc splashes at midnight,
		Talking bell.

		stands high
		Don't even put on your hats.
		The song is not given a secret,
		Where to live and where to die.

		But in the declining years
		Roads lead to the father's house.
		Will be driven by deaf drogs
		Half corpse, half skeleton.

		After all, for a long time
		There is a saying among the people:
		Even the dog in the master 's yard
		Breathing always comes.

		I turn back to my father's house -
		The poor wanderer lived and did not live ...

		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		In the blue evening over the pond
		Hemp will shed.

		Above the window is a month. Under the window wind.
		The flown poplar is silvery and bright.

		The distant cry of a talyanka, a lonely voice -
		And so dear, and so distant.

		Crying and laughing dashing song.
		Where are you, my linden? Linden age-old?

		I myself once on a holiday early in the morning
		He went out to his beloved, unfolded the talyanka.

		And now I mean nothing dear.
		Under someone else's song and laugh and cry.

		August 1925


* * *

		Bless each work, good luck!
		To a fisherman - so that a net with fish,
		Plowman - so that his plow and nag
		They got bread for a year.

		They drink water from mugs and glasses,
		You can also drink from water lilies -
		Where the pool of pink fogs
		The shore will not get tired of gilding.

		It's good to lie in the green grass
		And, digging into the ghostly expanse,
		Someone's look, jealous and in love,
		On myself, tired, to remember.

		The corncrakes are whistling... the corncrakes...
		That's why it's always bright
		Those that in life have become empty hearted
		Under the cheerful burden of labor.

		Only I forgot that I am a peasant,
		And now I tell myself
		Idle spy, am I not strange
		Dear me arable land and forests.

		Slo clearly sorry for someone and someone,
		As if someone has lost the habit of the homeland,
		And from that, rising above the swamp,
		A lapwing and a sandpiper cry into the soul.

		July 1925


* * *

		Apparently, it's been like this forever -
		By the age of thirty, having gone crazy,
		All stronger, burnt cripples,
		with life .

		Honey, I'll be thirty soon
		And the earth is dearer to me every day.
		That's why my heart began to dream
		That I burn with pink fire.

		Kohl burn, so burn burning,
		And not without reason in the lime blossom
		I took out the ring from the parrot -
		A sign that together we will burn.

		That ring was given to me by a gypsy.
		I took it off my hand and gave it to you
		And now, when the hurdy-gurdy is sad,
		I can't help but think, I can't help but be shy.

		In the head of the swamp roams the whirlpool,
		And frost and haze on the heart:
		Maybe someone else
		Did you give it away with a laugh?

		Maybe kissing before dawn
		He asks you himself
		Like a funny, stupid poet
		You led to sensual verses.

		Well, so what! This wound will also pass.
		Only bitter to see the edge of life.
		For the first time such a bully
		Tricked the damn parrot.

		July 1925


* * *

		Leaves are falling, leaves are falling.
		The wind is blowing
		Long and deaf.
		Who will please the heart?
		Who will comfort him, my friend?

		With heavy eyelids
		I look and look at the moon.
		Here again the roosters have been scolded
		Into an eerie silence.

		Predawn. Blue. Early.
		And flying stars grace.
		Make a wish,
		I don't know what to wish for.

		What to desire under the burden of life,
		Cursing your inheritance and home?
		I would like to have a good
		He sees a girl under the window.

		So that with cornflower blue eyes
		Only me -
		Not to anyone -
		And with new words and feelings
		Calms the heart and chest.

		So that under this white moonlight,
		Taking a happy lot,
		I didn't melt over the song, I didn't melt
		And with someone else's cheerful youth
		He never regretted his.

* * *

		Burn, my star, do not fall.
		Drop cold rays.
		After all, behind the cemetery fence
		A living heart does not beat.

		You shine with August and rye
		And fill the silence of the fields
		Such a sobbing jerk
		Unflying cranes.

		And, raising your head higher,
		Not that behind the grove - behind the hill
		I hear someone's song again
		About the father's land and father's house.

		And golden autumn
		In birches, reducing the juice,
		For all those who loved and abandoned,
		Foliage cries on the sand.

		I know, I know. Soon soon
		Not mine or anyone else's fault
		Under a low mourning fence
		I will have to lie down too.

		The gentle flame will go out,
		And my heart will turn to dust.
		Friends will put a gray stone
		With a cheerful inscription in verse.

		But, listening to the funeral sadness ,
		I would put it like this for myself:
		He loved his homeland and land,
		How the drunkard loves the tavern.

		Life is a deception with enchanting longing,
		That's why she's so strong
		That with his rough hand
		Fatal writes letters.

		I always, when I close my eyes,
		I say: "Just disturb the heart,
		Life is a lie, but sometimes it
		Decorates with joy lies.

		Turn your face to the gray sky
		By the moon, wondering about fate,
		Calm down, mortal, and do not demand
		The truth that you do not need.

		Good in the bird cherry blizzard
		To think that this life is a path
		Let light friends deceive
		Let light friends change.

		Let them caress me with a gentle word,
		Let the evil tongue be sharper than a razor, -
		I live for a long time ready for anything,
		To everything ruthlessly accustomed.

		chill my soul,
		There is no heat from star fire.
		Those whom I loved have abandoned
		What I lived - they forgot about me.

		But still, oppressed and persecuted,
		I, looking at the dawn with a smile,
		On earth, close and beloved to me,
		Thank you for everything in this life.

		Rash, talyanka, loudly, rash, talyanka, boldly
		Remember, perhaps, youth, the one that flew by?
		Do not make noise, aspen, do not dust, dear.
		Let the song rush to the sweetheart to the threshold.

		Let her hear, let her cry.
		Someone else's youth means nothing to her .
		Well, if it means - live without suffering.
		Where are you, my joy? Where are you, my fate?

		Flow, song, more, flow, the song is ringing.
		It still won't be what it used to be.
		For bylup strength, pride and posture
		Only the song remained under the talyanka.

Sister Shura

		I have not seen such beautiful
		Only, you know, I hide in my soul
		Not in a bad, but in a good offense -
		You repeat my youth.

		You are my cornflower blue word
		I love you forever.
		How does our cow live now,
		Sadness with a straw pull?

		You will sing, and I love
		Heal me with a child's dream.
		Did our mountain ash burn out,
		Showering under a white window?

		What is the mother singing now behind the tow?
		I left the village forever
		I only know - a crimson blizzard
		We got leaves on the porch.

		I know what about you and me together
		Instead of affection and instead of tears
		At the gate, like a bent bride,
		An abandoned dog howls softly.

		But still, you don't have to go back.
		That's why I didn't get it on time.
		Like love, like sadness and joy,
		Your beautiful Ryazan scarf.

		Oh, how many cats in the world,
		You and I will never count them.
		The heart dreams of sweet peas,
		And the blue star is ringing.

		Will I wake up, in delirium or awake,
		I only remember from a distant day -
		A kitten purred on the bed ,
		Looking at me indifferently.

		I was still a child then
		But jump to grandmother's song
		He rushed like a young tiger cub,
		On the ball she dropped.

		Everything is gone. I lost my grandmother
		And a few years later
		They made a hat out of that cat ,
		And our grandfather wore it out.

		September 13, 1925

Sister Shura

		You sing me that song that before
		Our old mother sang to us.
		No regrets for the lost hope
		I can sing along to you.

		I know, and I know
		Therefore, worry and worry -
		If I'm from my native home
		I hear a gentle tremor in my voice.

		You sing to me, well, and I'm with this one,
		Here with the same song as you
		Just close my eyes a little
		I see dear features again.

		You sing to me. After all, my consolation -
		That I have never loved alone
		And the gate of the autumn garden,
		And fallen leaves from mountain ash.

		You sing to me, well, I'll remember
		And I will not forgetfully frown:
		So nice and so easy for me
		Seeing mother and yearning chickens.

		I'm forever behind fogs and dews
		I fell in love with the birch camp,
		And her golden braids
		And her canvas Sara fan.

		Therefore, the heart is not hard -
		Me for a song and for wine
		You seemed like that birch
		What is under the native window.

		September 13, 1925

Sister Shura

		In this world I'm just a passerby
		You wave your cheerful hand to me.
		In the autumn month too
		The light is caressing, so quiet.

		For the first time, I warm myself from a month,
		For the first time from the coolness warmed,
		And again and live and hope
		For a love that no longer exists.

		This made our flatness,
		Salted with a linen of sand,
		And someone's crumpled innocence,
		And to someone, a native melancholy.

		That's why I won't hide forever
		That love is not separate, not apart -
		We have one love with you
		This homeland was brought.

		September 13, 1925


EARTH CAPTAIN

		Nobody else
		Didn't rule the planet
		And no one
		My song was not sung.
		Only he
		With your hand uplifted
		Said the world is
		United family.

		I'm not seduced
		Hymns to the hero
		I don't tremble
		Lived in a bloodline.
		I'm happy that
		What is gloomy sometimes
		One feeling
		I breathed with him
		And he lived.

		Not like we
		which everything is so
		Close,-
		fall into wonder
		And the elephants
		Like a humble boy
		From Simbirsk
		Became a helmsman
		Your country.

		Amid the roar of the waves
		In my clearing
		Slightly harsh
		And tenderly sweet
		He thought a lot
		In a Marxist way
		Quite Leninist
		Created.

		No!
		This is not Stenka's revelry!
		Not Pugachevsky
		Riot and throne!
		He didn't put anyone
		To the wall.
		did everything
		Only human law.

		He's in the mind
		Courage full,
		Only just attached
		to the steering wheel
		To about the cape
		The waves crashed
		giving space
		Ship.

		He is the helmsman
		And the captain.
		Are you afraid with him
		Squall slopes?
		After all, collected
		From different countries
		His entire party
		Sailors.

		Don't be afraid
		Who is not used to the sea:
		They are for the best
		vows
		Will ignite
		Coming down to the mainland
		Guiding lights.

		Then the poet
		Another fate
		And it's not me
		And he is between you
		Will sing you songs
		In honor of the struggle
		Others
		New words.

		He will say:
		"Only that swimmer
		Who, having tempered
		In the struggles of the soul
		Opened to the world at last
		Nobody has seen
		Dry land."

		Hey sled! And horses, horses!
		Apparently, the devil brought them to earth.
		In the dashing steppe acceleration
		The bell laughs to tears.

		No moon, no dogs barking
		In the distance, aside, in the wasteland.
		Hold on, my life is remote,
		I haven't gotten around to it yet .

		Sing, coachman, in defiance of this night, -
		If you want, I'll sing to you myself
		About sly girlish eyes,
		About my cheerful youth.

		Oh, you used to break your hat,
		Yes, you will lay a horse in the shafts,
		Yes, lie down on an armful of hay, -
		Just remember what my name was.

		Where did posture come from?
		And in the midnight silence
		Talkative talyanka
		Persuaded not one.

		Everything is gone. Thinned my hair.
		The horse is dead, our yard is empty.
		Talyanka lost her voice,
		Learned how to talk.

		But still the soul has not cooled down,
		Snow and frost are so pleasant to me,
		Because over everything that was
		The bell laughs to tears.

		September 19, 1925


* * *

		Snow jam is crushed and pricked,
		The chilled moon shines from above.
		Again I see my native outskirts,
		Through a snowstorm, a light at the window.

		We are all homeless, how much do we need.
		What was given to me, I sing about.
		Here I am again at my parent's dinner,
		Again I see my old woman.

		He looks, and his eyes are watery, watery,
		Quiet, silent, as if without torment.
		Wants to take a tea cup -
		The teacup slips from my hands.

		Sweet, kind, old, tender,
		Do not be friends with sad thoughts,
		Listen - under this snowy harmonica
		I'll tell you about my life.

		Much have I seen, and much have I travelled,
		I loved a lot and suffered a lot,
		And that's why the bully silt and got drunk,
		That I didn't see anyone better than you.

		Here again I am warming myself by the couch,
		He dropped his shoes, his jacket section.
		Again I came to life and again I hope
		Just like in childhood, for the best destiny.

		And outside the window under the blizzard sobs,
		In the wild and noisy blizzard ,
		It seems to me that lindens are crumbling,
		White lindens in our garden.

		September 20, 1925


* * *

		You hear - the sleigh is rushing, you hear - the sleigh is rushing.
		It's good to get lost in the field with your beloved.

		The breeze is cheerful, timid and shy,
		A naked bell rolls across the plain .

		Oh, sleigh, sleigh! You are my horse!
		Somewhere in the clearing, a maple tree is dancing drunk.

		We will drive up to him, ask - what is it?
		And we will dance together under the talyanka three.

		October 3, 1925


* * *

		Blue jacket. Blue eyes.
		I didn't tell any sweet truth .

		Sweetheart asked: "Does the blizzard spin?
		Light the stove, make the bed."

		I answered dear: "Today from a height
		Someone showers white flowers.

		Light the stove, make the bed,
		My heart is in a blizzard without you."

		October 3, 1925


* * *

		Snow jam twists briskly,
		A trio of strangers is rushing across the field.

		Someone else's youth rushes on a troika.
		Where is my happiness? Where is my joy?

		Everything rolled away under a brisk whirlwind
		Here on the same crazy trio.

		4/5 October 1925


* * *

		moonlit evening
		I used to be handsome and young.

		Unstoppable, unique
		Everything flew ... far ... past ...

		The heart has cooled, and the eyes have faded ...
		Blue happiness! Lunar nights!

		4/5 October 1925


* * *

		Do not twist your smile, pulling your hands,
		I love another, but not you .

		You yourself know, you know well -
		I don't see you, I didn't come to you.

		I passed by, my heart doesn't care -
		I just wanted to look out the window.

		4/5 October 1925


* * *

		Poor writer, is that you?
		Do you write songs about the moon?
		For a long time my eyes have cooled down
		On love, on cards and wine.

		Ah, the moon climbs through the frame,
		Such a light, even poke out your eyes ...
		I bet on the Queen of Spades
		And he played the ace of diamonds.

		4/5 October 1925


* * *

		Blue fog. snow expanse,
		Subtle lemon moonlight.
		The heart is pleased with quiet pain
		Something to remember from my early years.

		The snow on the porch is like quicksand.
		Here, with the same moon without words,
		Pushing a hat from a cat on his forehead,
		I secretly left my father's firewood.

		Again I returned to my native land.
		Who remembers me ? Who forgot?
		I stand sadly, like a persecuted wanderer,
		The old owner of his hut.

		Silently I crumple a new hat,
		I don't like sable fur.
		I remembered my grandfather, I remembered my grandmother,
		I remembered the graveyard loose snow.

		Everyone calmed down, we'll all be there,
		As in this life, for the sake of not for the sake of, -
		That's why I'm so drawn to people
		That's why I love people so much.

		That's why I almost cried
		And, smiling, his soul went out, -
		This hut on the porch with a dog
		It's like I'm seeing it for the last time.

		September 24 , 1925


* * *

		The blizzard is crying like a gypsy violin.
		Sweet girl, evil smile
		Am I not shy from the blue look?
		I need a lot and I don't need a lot.

		So we are far away and so different -
		You are young, and I lived everything.
		Happiness for young men, but only memory for me
		Snowy night in a dashing hush.

		I am not caressed - the storm is my violin.
		Your smile is heartbreaking.
		October 4/5, 1925


* * *

		Oh, such a blizzard, just damn it!
		Clogs the roof with white nails.
		Only I'm not afraid, and in my destiny
		With an unlucky heart, I am nailed to you.

		October 4/5, 1925


* * *

		Snowy plain, white moon,
		Our side is covered with a shroud.
		And birches in white are crying through the forests.
		Who died here? Died? Am I myself?

		October 4/5, 1925


* * *

		The wind whistles, the silver wind
		In the silky rustle of snow noise.
		For the first time I noticed in myself -
		So I have never thought.

		Let there be rotten dampness on the windows,
		I am not sorry and I am not sad.
		I still love this life
		I fell in love with it like it was in the beginning.

		Will the woman look with a quiet smile -
		I'm already excited. What shoulders!
		A troika will ride on an expensive unsteady -
		I'm already in it and jumping far.

		Oh, my happiness and all good luck!
		Human happiness is loved by the earth.
		Whoever cries at least once on earth -
		So luck has run its course.

		You need to live easier, you need to live easier,
		All accepting what is in the world.
		That's why, stunned, over the grove
		The wind whistles, the silver wind.

		October 14, 1925


* * *

		Small forests. Steppe and gave.
		Moonlight all the way.
		Here again they suddenly sobbed
		Draft bells.

		ugly road,
		Yes, forever beloved
		which I traveled a lot
		Every Russian person.

		Hey sled! What a sled!
		Ringing frozen aspens.
		My father is a farmer
		Well, I'm a peasant's son.

		I don't care about fame
		And that I am a poet.
		This shabby area
		I haven't seen it for many years.

		The one who has seen at least once
		This edge and this surface,
		The one almost every birch
		I'm glad to kiss the leg.

		How can I not cry
		If with a wreath in cold and ring
		There will be a house to have fun
		Youth of Russian villages.

		Oh, harmonica, death is poison,
		Know from that under this howl
		Not one dashing glory
		Lost tryn-grass.

		October 21/22, 1925


* * *

		Flowers say goodbye to me
		Bowing their heads down,
		That I will never see
		Her face and fatherland.

		Beloved, well, well! Well!
		I saw them and I saw the earth
		And this deathly trembling
		How to accept a new kindness.

		And because I realized
		All my life, passing by with a smile, -
		I say every moment
		That everything in the world is repeatable.

		It doesn't matter, another one will come,
		The sadness of the departed will not swallow,
		abandoned and dear
		The one who comes will compose a better song.

		And, listening to the song in silence,
		Beloved with another beloved
		Maybe he will remember me
		How about a unique flower.

		October 27 , 1925


* * *

		You are my fallen maple, icy maple,
		Why are you standing bending under a white blizzard?

		Or what did you see? Or what did you hear?
		As if you went out for a walk in the village.

		And, like a drunken watchman, going out onto the road,
		He drowned in a snowdrift, froze his leg.

		Oh, and now I myself have become somewhat unstable,
		I won't get home from a friendly drinking party.

		There he met a willow, there he noticed a pine tree,
		He sang songs to them under a blizzard about summer.

		To myself I seemed to be the same maple,
		Only not fallen, but with might and main green.

		And, having lost modesty, having become foolish on the board,
		Like someone else's wife, he hugged a birch.

		November 28, 1925


* * *

		What a night! I can't.
		I can't sleep. Such moonlight.
		Still like a shore
		Lost youth in my soul.

		Girlfriend of the cold years
		Don't call the game love
		Better this moonlight
		It flows to me to the headboard.

		Let the distorted features
		He outlines boldly -
		After all, you can not stop loving
		How can you not love.

		You can only love once.
		That's why you're a stranger to me
		That lindens are vain but beckon us,
		Immerse your feet in the snowdrifts.

		Because I know and you know
		What is in this glow of the moon, blue
		There are no flowers on these lindens -
		There is snow and hoarfrost on these lindens.

		What we have fallen in love with for a long time
		You are not me, but I am another,
		And we both don't care
		Play love cheap.

		But still caress and hug
		In the sly passion of a kiss,
		May my heart always dream of May
		And the one I love forever.

		November 30, 1925


* * *

		Don't look at me reproachfully
		I do not hide contempt for you,
		But I love your pack with a lanyard
		And your crafty meekness.

		Yes, you seem to me prostrate,
		And, perhaps, I'm glad to see
		Like a fox pretending to be dead
		Catches ravens and crows.

		Well, well, catch it, I'm not afraid.
		But how would your ardor not go out?
		On my chilled soul
		across such more than once.

		I don't love you dear
		You're just an echo, just a shadow.
		I dream of another in your face,
		Whose eyes are doves.

		Don't let her look meek
		And, perhaps, it looks cold,
		But she has a stately gait
		It shook my soul to the core.

		Here's one you can hardly fog up,
		And if you don't want to go, you can go
		Well, you don't even lie to your heart
		Lies filled with caress.

		But still, despising you,
		I am embarrassed to open forever:
		If there were no hell and heaven,
		Man himself would have invented them .

		December 1, 1925


* * *

		You don't love me, don't pity me
		Am I a little handsome?
		Without looking in the face, you are thrilled with passion,
		Putting my hands on my shoulders.

		Young, with a sensual grin,
		I am not gentle with you and not rude.
		Tell me, how many did you ask?
		How many hands do you remember? How many lips?

		I know they passed like shadows
		Without touching your fire
		To many you sat on your knees,
		And now you're sitting here with me.

		May your eyes be half closed
		And you think of someone else
		I myself do not love you very much,
		Drowning in a distant road.

		Don't call this ardor fate
		Frivolous quick-tempered connection, -
		How by chance I met you
		I smile and calmly disperse.

		Yes, and you will go your own way
		Spread the gloomy days
		Just don't touch the innocent ones,
		Only unburned do not mani.

		And when with another down the lane
		You will pass, talking about love,
		Maybe I'll go for a walk
		And we will meet with you again.

		Turning your shoulders closer to the other
		And leaning down a little
		You tell me quietly: "Good evening!"
		I will answer: "Good evening, miss."

		And nothing will disturb the soul
		And nothing will shake her,
		Who loved, he cannot love,
		Who is burned, you will not set fire to.

		December 4, 1925


* * *

		Maybe too late, maybe too soon
		And what I have not thought about for many years,
		I began to resemble Don Juan,
		Like a real windy poet.

		What's happened? What happened to me?
		Every day I am at other knees.
		Every day I lose my pity
		Not resigned to the bitterness of change.

		I always wanted a smaller heart
		Hovered in tender and simple feelings,
		What am I looking for in the eyes of these women -
		Frivolous, deceitful and empty?

		Hold me, my contempt,
		I have always been marked by you.
		Cold boil in my soul
		And blue rustle of lilacs.

		On the soul - the lemon light of sunset,
		And all the same is heard through the fog, -
		For freedom in feelings there is a retribution,
		Accept the challenge, Don Juan!

		And, calmly accepting the challenge,
		I see that I am one and the same -
		Honor the blizzard for the blue pollen of May,
		Call sensual trembling love .

		It happened, it happened to me
		And from that I have many knees,
		So that happiness smiles forever
		Not resigned to the bitterness of change.

		December 13, 1925


* * *

		Who am I? What am I? Only a dreamer
		The ring of happiness seeking in the darkness,
		I live this life as if by the way,
		Together with others on earth.

		And I kiss you out of habit,
		Because I kissed many
		And, as if lighting matches,
		I speak love words.

		"darling", "sweetheart", "forever"
		And in my mind it's always the same
		If you touch the passions in a person ,
		Of course you won't find the truth.

		That's why my soul is not hard
		Neither desire nor demand fire,
		You, my walking birch,
		Created for many and me.

		But, always looking for my own
		And languishing in unkind captivity,
		I'm not jealous of you at all
		I don't curse you at all.

		Who am I? What am I? Only a dreamer
		The blue of the eyes lost in the darkness,
		And I loved you only by the way,
		Together with others on earth.

		1925


* * *

		Goodbye my friend, goodbye.
		My dear, you are in my chest.
		Destined parting
		Promises to meet in the future.

		Goodbye, my friend, without a hand, without a word,
		Do not be sad and do not sadness of the eyebrows, -
		In this life, dying is not new,
		But to live, of course, is not newer.

		1925


MY WAY

		Life enters the shores.
		The village is a longtime resident ,
		I remember that
		What I saw in the edge.
		my poems,
		Calmly tell
		About my life.

		Peasant's hut.
		The pungent smell of tar,
		Goddess old,
		The lamps are soft light.
		How good
		that I saved you
		All the feelings of childhood.

		Under the windows
		White blizzard fire.
		I am nine years old.
		Couch, grandmother, cat ...
		And the grandmother is something sad,
		Steppe sang,
		sometimes yawning
		And cross your mouth.

		The blizzard roared.
		Under the window
		As if the dead were dancing.
		Then the empire
		Waging war with the Japanese
		And all distant
		Crosses appeared.

		Then I didn't know
		Black affairs of Russia.
		Didn't know why
		And why the war.
		Ryazan fields,
		Where the men mowed
		Where they sowed their grain
		Was my country.

		I only remember
		What the men grumbled
		Fought to hell
		In God and in the king.
		But in response to them
		They only smiled
		Yes, our liquid
		Lemon Dawn.

		Then for the first time
		I messed with the rhyme.
		From a host of feelings
		The head turned.
		And I said
		If this itch woke up,
		I will spill my whole soul into words.

		years distant,
		Now you are in a fog.
		And I remember my grandfather
		Sadly he said:
		"Empty business...
		Well, if it pulls -
		Write about rye
		But more about mares.

		Then in the brain
		Attraction to the muse is compressed,
		Dreams flowed
		In secret silence
		What will I
		famous and rich m
		And there will be a monument
		Stand in Ryazan me.

		At fifteen
		I fell in love to the liver
		And thought sweetly
		I'll just be alone
		What am I on this
		The best of girls
		When I get old, I get married.
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

		Years flowed.
		Years change faces -
		another one on them
		Light falls.
		Rural dreamer -
		I am in the capital
		He became a top notch poet.

		And getting sick
		Writer's boredom
		I went to wander
		Among different countries
		I do not believe in meetings
		Not yearning for separation
		Considering the whole world for deceit.

		Then I realized
		What is Rus'.
		I understood what glory is.
		And that's why I
		Sadness in the soul
		Came in like a bitter poison.

		Why the hell do I
		What a poet I am!
		And without me, plenty of rubbish.
		Let me die
		Only......
		No,
		Do not erect a monument in Ryazan!

		Russia... Tsarshchina...
		Yearning...
		And the indulgence of the nobility.
		Well!
		So accept, Moscow,
		Desperate bullying.

		Let's see -
		Who will take whom!
		And in my verses
		scored
		In salon polished
		Rabble
		Ryazan ko was urine .

		I do not like?
		Yes you are right -
		Habit to Lorigan
		And for roses...
		But this bread
		What are you eating -
		After all, we are his that-s...
		Manure...

		More years have passed.
		In years it was
		What is in words
		Do not tell everything:
		To replace the king
		With majestic strength
		The working army appeared.

		Tired of hanging around
		Beyond the borders
		I returned
		To the native home.
		green-haired,
		In a white skirt
		There is a birch tree above the pond.

		Already a birch!
		Wonderful ... And breasts ...
		Such breasts
		You won't find women.
		From the fields splashed by the sun
		People
		They drive towards me
		Rye in carts.

		They don't recognize me
		I am a passer-by.
		But here goes
		Baba, without looking.
		Some kind of current
		unspeakable trembling
		I feel all over my back.

		Is she?
		Didn't you know?
		Well, let
		Let yourself pass...
		And without me she
		A lot of bitterness -
		No wonder he lay down
		Painfully so mouth.

		In the evenings,
		Pulling down the cap,
		In order not to give out
		cold eyes,
		I go to watch
		sloping steppes
		And listen
		How the stream sounds.

		So what?
		Youth is gone!
		It's time for me to take
		For the cause
		So that a mischievous soul
		Already in a mature way she sang.

		And let another life of the village
		Will fill me
		new strength,
		Like before
		Led to fame
		Native Russian mare.

A TALE ABOUT THE SHEPHERD PET, HIS COMMISSION AND THE KINGDOM OF THE COW

		Shepherd Petya
		It's hard to live in the world
		fine twig
		Manage livestock.

		If the cow
		understood the word
		That would be Pete's life
		Better not in the world.

		But the cows are down
		On the grass near the forest
		Speak Russian -
		They don't think for a moment.

		They would only mumble
		Yes, the grass swayed.
		It's hard to live in the world
		Shepherd Petya.

		*

		good in spring
		Think under the pine
		Smiling in the slumber
		About home.

		May is getting better
		They ate everything with a needle;
		On a cow's neck
		The bell is crying.

		Crying and laughing
		On flowers and herbs,
		The voice is heard
		Ringing in the middle of the oak forest.

		Petya the Shepherd
		Voices are not new
		He will find a side
		Where the cows call.

		Brings everyone together
		Driven to the village
		Will not get a thrill -
		Honor will not drop.

		Ljubo sickness Austin
		Manage livestock.
		At night by the woods
		Sleep and spit for a month.

		*

		Well, what if it's summer?
		The song is badly sung.
		Too much to do -
		The rye has ripened in the field.

		Ah, not from that
		The days have gotten better
		All ears in the field
		Like swan necks.

		But food in the world
		Ready every hour
		Petya gaped -
		A cow will go into the rye.

		And the man looks
		Will spread the hand
		Yes, how to pull in the back
		Straight whips.

		Hard with a twig
		Manage livestock.

		*

		Here comes autumn
		With a chain of maples naked x,
		What makes noise like eight
		They are merry.

		Wet leaf from aspen
		And road willows
		So it whips in the back,
		In the back and in the neck.

		Is it a fir tree, is it a bush,
		Just down to the skin
		Boots got wet
		Clothes too.

		Someone to open up
		All as is lost.
		scared bird
		Flies into the thicket.

		And tremble for half a day
		Either soul or body.
		Tell the duck -
		The duck has flown away.

		Tell the dubrovs -
		Fall at the oak tree.
		Tell the cows
		They would only burst.

		No, no one in the world
		On a wet slope
		Shepherd Petya
		He won't understand Russian.

		Difficult twig
		Manage livestock.

		*

		Petya thinks with fervor:
		What's the matter in the world
		He lived as a commissioner
		At your apartment.

		If he knew all the dates,
		Would be all speeches,
		Collected quitrents
		Yes, I cleaned the horns.

		And through the viscous mud,
		By autumn shaking
		Ride every time
		In a hair-carriage.

		And Petya dreamed
		Terrible dream in the world.

		*

		Everything is available in the world.
		Petya Commissioner
		At your apartment
		With a fat samovar.

		Drinking tea on the terrace ,
		Rides in a tarantass
		Better not in the world
		Life than Petya's.

		But always in vain
		Serve as a commissioner.
		You need to know all the dates
		To collect dues.

		Tea, of course, is sweet,
		And with jam twice,
		But keep order
		Maybe not everyone.

		Need to know the laws
		Well, where is Pete?
		He is still an icon
		Keeps in the council.

		And around the council
		In rain and bad weather
		From the very dawn
		Take the people.

		Our people are naked
		Whatever the day, then with the requirement.
		Then build them a school
		Then give them bread.

		Who fooled them?
		Who screwed them up?
		For some reason very
		They needed a tractor.

		Well, where is Pete?
		He was herding cattle
		Understood in the world
		Only sickness.

		And the people are harsh
		In murmur and din
		Worse than cows
		Worse and stubborn.

		With such a product
		It sucks to be a commissar.

		Once they took Petrusha
		For the life, for the soul,
		Thrown into a stroller
		Yes, how they gave a task ...
		. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
		Peter woke up...

		*

		It's sweet to live in the world!

		I got up, and the day is what you need,
		Sunny, ringing,
		Light cold
		Fans the bowls.

		Peter with a meek word
		Says to the cows:
		"I do not want and for nothing
		I'll be the commissar."

		And above it is a birch,
		Wiping with a branch,
		Speaks through tears
		Smiling softly:

		"It's hard in the world
		Be an example for everyone.
		Be better, Petya,
		Formerly a pioneer.

		To kids in awe,
		On a wet autumn day
		Wrote that story
		I am Sergei Yesenin.

Persian motifs (1924 - 1925)



* * *

		My former wound subsided -
		Drunk delirium does not gnaw at my heart.
		Blue flowers of Tehran
		I am treating them today in a teahouse.

		The teahouse owner himself with round shoulders,
		To be famous before the Russian teahouse,
		Gives me red tea
		Instead of strong vodka and wine.

		Treat, master, but not very much.
		Many roses bloom in your garden.
		Suddenly my eyes blinked,
		Pulling back the black veil.

		We are spring girls in Russia
		We do not keep on the chain, like dogs,
		We learn to kiss without money,
		Without dagger tricks and fights.

		Well, this one is for the movement of the camp,
		With a face like the dawn
		I will give a shawl from Ho Rossana
		And I'll give you a Shiraz carpet.

		Pour, master, stronger tea,
		I will never lie to you.
		I am responsible for myself now.
		I cannot answer for you.

		And you don't look at the door very much,
		Anyway, there is a gate in the garden ...
		Suddenly my eyes blinked
		Priot throwing a black veil.

		I asked the money changer today
		What gives a ruble for half a fog,
		How to tell me for the lovely Lala
		In Persian gentle "I love"?

		I asked the money changer today
		Lighter than the wind, quieter than the Van jets,
		How to call me for the beautiful Lala
		Affectionate word "kiss"?

		And I also asked the money changer,
		In the heart of shyness is deeper,
		How to tell me for the beautiful Lala,
		How to tell her that she is "mine"?

		And the changer answered me briefly:
		Words don't talk about love
		About love they sigh only furtively,
		Yes, eyes, like yachts, burn.

		The kiss has no name
		A kiss is not an inscription on coffins.
		Red rose kisses blow,
		Petals melt on the lips.

		Love does not require bail,
		With her know joy and trouble.
		"You are mine" only hands can say,
		That tore off the black veil.

		Shagane you are mine, Shagane!
		Because I'm from the north, or something,
		I'm ready to tell you the field
		About wavy rye in the moonlight.
		Shagane you are mine, Shagane.

		Because I'm from the north, or something,
		That the moon is a hundred times bigger there,
		No matter how beautiful Shiraz is,
		It is no better than Ryazan expanses.
		Because I'm from the north, or something.

		I'm ready to tell you the field
		I took this hair from the rye,
		If you want, knit on your finger -
		I don't feel any pain at all.
		I am ready to tell you the field.

		About wavy rye in the moonlight
		You can guess by my curls.
		Darling, joke, smile
		Do not wake up only the memory in me
		About wavy rye in the moonlight.

		Shagane you are mine, Shagane!
		There, in the north, the girl too,
		She looks a lot like you
		Maybe he's thinking about me...
		Shagane you are mine, Shagane.

		You said that Saadi
		Kissed only on the chest.
		Wait, for God's sake
		I'll learn someday!

		You sang: "Beyond the Euphrates
		Roses are better than mortal maidens."
		If I were rich
		Then the other added a chant.

		I would cut these roses
		After all, one consolation to me -
		To not be in the world
		Better than dear Shagane.

		And do not torment me with a covenant,
		I have no promises.
		If I was born a poet,
		I kiss like a poet.

		I have never been to the Bosphorus
		You don't ask me about him.
		I saw the sea in your eyes
		Blazing blue fire.

		I did not go to Baghdad with a caravan,
		I did not take silk and henna there.
		Bend over with your beautiful figure,
		Let me rest on my knees.

		Or again, no matter how much I ask,
		There is no business for you forever
		What is in the distant name - Russia -
		I am a famous, recognized poet.

		Talyanka rings in my soul,
		In the moonlight, I hear a dog barking.
		Don't you want, Persian,
		See the distant blue edge?

		I came here not out of boredom -
		You called me, invisible.
		And me your swan hands
		Wrapped around like two wings.

		I've been looking for peace in fate for a long time,
		And although I do not curse my past life,
		Tell me something
		About your funny country.

		Drown in your soul the anguish of taliank and,
		Drink the breath of fresh spells,
		So that I'm talking about a far northerner
		I didn't sigh, I didn't think, I didn't get bored.

		And although I have not been to the Bosphorus -
		I'll think of it for you.
		Anyway - your eyes are like the sea,
		Blue swaying fire.

		Garden - in wild bloom,
		You can't keep your eyes on

		You will walk through the meadow like a garden.

		Do not bow your head to the slabs.

		Look around, how good a friend:

		Make peace only in your heart with the enemy -
		And saffron you with bliss.

		To live is to live like this, to love is to fall in love like that
		Kiss and walk in moonlight gold
		If you want to worship the dead,
		Do not poison the living with that dream.

		Being a poet means the same
		If the truth of life is not violated,
		Scarring your soft skin
		Caress other people's souls with the blood of feelings.

		To be a poet means to sing expanse,
		To be known to you.
		The nightingale sings - it does not hurt him,
		He has the same song.

		Canary from someone else's voice -
		Pathetic, funny trinket.
		The world needs a song word
		Sing in your own way, even like a frog.

		Mohammed outwitted in the Koran,
		Prohibiting strong drinks
		Because the poet will not stop
		Drink wine when going to torture.

		And when the poet goes to his beloved,
		And the beloved with another lies on the bed,
		Blessed with life-giving stored,
		He will not run a knife into her heart.

		But, burning with jealous courage,
		Will whistle aloud to the house:
		"Well, well, I'll die a tramp,
		On earth, and we know it."

		Sweet hands - a pair of swans -
		Dive into the gold of my hair.
		Everything in this world and people
		The song of love is sung and repeated.

		I sang and I was once far away
		And now I sing about the same thing again
		That's why I breathe deeply
		Tenderness impregnated word.

		If you love the soul to the bottom,
		The heart will turn into a block of gold,
		Only Tehran moon
		Will not warm the songs with warmth.

		I don't know how to live my life
		Whether to burn out in the caresses of the sweet Steps
		Or under old age anxiously grieve
		About past song courage?

		Everything has its own gait:
		What is pleasing to the ear, what is to the eye.
		If a Persian composes a bad song,
		This means that he is never from Shiraz.

		About me and for these songs
		Talk like this among people:
		He would sing more tenderly and more wonderfully,
		Yes, killed a couple of swans.

		"Why does the moon shine so dimly
		On the gardens and walls of Horossan?
		As if I walk the Russian plain
		Under the rustling canopy of fog

		So I asked, dear Lala,
		By the silent cypresses at night,
		But their army did not say a word,
		Heads proudly raised to the sky.

		"Why does the moon shine so sadly?" -
		I asked the flowers in a quiet thicket,
		And the flowers said : "You feel
		By the sadness of a rustling rose.

		Rose petals spilled,
		Secretly told me with petals:
		"Your Shagane caressed with another,
		Shagane kissed another.

		She said: "The Russian will not notice ...
		The heart is a song, and the song is life and body ... "
		That's why the moon shines so dimly
		That's why she turned sad.

		Seen too much betrayal
		Tears and torments, who were waiting for them, who do not want.

		Heart, at least you fell asleep
		Here, on the knees of my dear.

		Dear Helia, I'm sorry.
		Many roses are on the way
		Many roses bend and bend
		But only one will smile with her heart.

		Let's smile together - you and me -
		For such lovely places.
		Wind from the sea, quieter blow and vey -
		Do you hear the nightingale calling the rose?

		Blue and cheerful country.
		Let my whole life be sold for a song,
		But for Helium in the shadows of the branches
		Nightingale hugs a rose.

		Dark night, can't sleep
		I'll go out to the river to the meadow.
		Unbelted lightning
		There is a belt in the dark waves.
		On a hillock a birch-candle
		In bright silver feathers.
		Come out my heart
		Listen to the songs of the harpist.
		I will fall in love, will I look
		For girlish beauty
		And I'll go dancing to the harp,
		So I'll rip your veil.
		I'll take you down the slopes
		In silk fields.
		Oh, whether the gusli-self-ringing,
		Psalmody feather grass.

		Trinity morning, morning canon,
		In the grove along the birch trees there is a loud chime .

		The village stretches from a festive dream,
		In the blessing of the wind, a drunken spring.

		Sing in the thicket, birds, I'll sing to you,
		Let's bury my youth together.

		Nonche at sunset from God's porch
		I will stand by the lectern next to the young man.

		Father's will, mother's order,
		Woe and grief will marry us.

		Oh, unwind your curls, cut off your braid,
		Without love, a girl's beauty will perish.

		The cat is napping on a beam.

		Dawns are blazing
		The fogs are smoking.
		Above the carved window
		Crimson curtain.

		Weave cobwebs
		With a golden tale.
		Somewhere a mouse is scratching
		In a closed cell...

		At the forest glade -
		In the ties, heaps of bread.
		Ate like spears
		Leaned into the sky.

		Fired up with smoke
		Under the dew of the grove.
		Rest in the heart
		Silence and power.

		I'll go in a skullcap, bright monk,
		Steppe path to the monasteries;
		Dry bag of twigs
		I'll hang it by the shoulders to the curls.
		I want to measure your ends
		Native Russia, I'm about the dew
		And believe in the happiness of your neighbor
		On the sloped lane.
		I'm going. My staff is ringing in the grass,
		The shawl of the dawn is waving in the face;
		Raking hay in the fields
		The mowers sing songs to me.
		Looking beyond the rings of bast strands,
		Just a dream I think:
		Happy, who has adorned his life
		The labor of earthly existence.
		With a smile of joyful happiness
		I go to other shores
		Having tasted the incorporeal communion,
		Praying for shocks and haystacks.

		Here everything is the same as it was then,

		I know, I didn't dream of fate
		The song is new in a quiet hut,
		And, as before, the Archangel's face
		Blows the reality of read books.
		Quiet, quiet in the divine corner,
		A month kneads kutya on the floor ...
		And only the mention of silence worries

		And, weathered by light rain,

		Here everything is the same as it was then,
		The same rivers and the same herds.

		Only willows above the red mound
		The shabby hem is shaken.

		Someone is folded, someone has sunk into darkness,
		No one can sing on the hill.

		Peacefully dreams of a native hearth
		About those who died in the darkness of the shoulders.

		Quiet, quiet in the divine corner,
		A month kneads kutya on the floor ...

		But disturbing only the mention of silence
		A shy mouse from the oven.

		In the hands of your innocents.

		I don't need the sigh of the grave
		A word with a secret cannot be embraced.
		Learn to be able
		Never wake up.

		We are all close relatives.

		We parted into the distance and wide
		Under the azure wing.
		But will call us from the psalter
		Dawn dawn psalm.

		And we will come with strawberries,
		Outlining the dark distance,
		At the fields of the native face

		Willow droppings in the meadows.

		As with the heavy gait of an ox,
		Stomachs, wheezing leaves,
		Trunks are dirty on the knees.

		Here it is, my flock is red!
		Who could sing it better?
		I see, I see the twilight lick
		Traces of human feet.

		Then you see how maple without looking back
		Comes out to the glass of the swamps
		And a little maple tree
		Wooden udder sucks.

		Rash, harmonica - boredom, boredom ...
		The harmonist pours his fingers in a wave.
		Drink with me you lousy bitch

		Loved you, isms zgali

		What are you looking at with blue splashes,
		Or in the face like it!?

		In the garden would you, on a scarecrow,
		Scare the crows!
		Tormented me to the liver
		From all sides!

		I am with you of women not with the first -
		Lots of you!
		But with a bitch like you
		Only for the first time!

		Rash, harmonica, rash, my frequent
		Drink, otter, drink!
		I'd rather be that busty one over there-
		She is dumber.

		And the further, the louder
		Here and there...
		I won't end myself
		Go to hell!

		To your pack of dogs
		Time to forgive!
		Honey, I'm crying...
		Sorry Sorry!


LENIN Excerpt from the poem "Walk-field"

		rebels

		I

		The law hasn't been fixed yet
		The country is noisy like bad weather.
		Whipped defiantly beyond the limit
		Freedom that poisoned us.

		Russia! Dear heart!
		The soul shrinks from pain.
		Cock crow, dog barking
		For ten years he has not heard the field.

		For ten years our quiet life
		Lost peaceful verbs.
		Like smallpox, pitted hooves
		Pastures and valleys are pitted.

		Silent clatter, loud groan,
		Carts and carts squeal.
		Am I sleeping and dreaming
		What's with the spears on all sides
		We are surrounded by Pechenegs.

		Not a dream! Not a dream! I see for real
		Nothing with a lulled look
		How, letting the horses swim,
		Squads jump after squad.

		Where are they? And where is the war?
		The steppe river does not heed the word.
		I don't know if the moon is shining
		Or the rider dropped the horseshoe.
		Everything is confused. But I understood the look:
		Native country to the edge from the edge,
		With fire and sabers sparkling,
		Internecine strife breaks.

		II

		Who did not seek the mercy of the strong,
		He was always on the run.
		My poetic passion
		I honor, as a liberty to remove.
		Ukraine! Terrible strange sound.
		Poplar in the trees, snowdrop in bloom.
		Where did he roll from?
		You alarmed rebel?

		Perky genius! He got me
		Attracts all over your figure.
		He, deftly jumping on a horse,
		[Fly<it?> ]

		But what's behind the foggy shiver?
		Whether the wind sways rye
		Or the human army moves,
		Has Zaporozhye really woken up?
		Again on the Poles, to fight,
		Is it the voice of former glory
		Stirred up the former Sich
		Direct trip to Warsaw,
		To win or lie down for everyone,
		Ile Tatars ferocious raid
		Again the country is causing a gap,
		Or in the vision of Mazepa
		Is he running abroad with a Swede?
		Neither this nor that.
		terrible year,
		Year eighteenth in history.
		Then a machine gun loomed
		Almost on every plateau,
		And almost every village
		Waging war with another village.
		Here in fights, brutally frenzied,
		They killed the reds, they beat the whites
		For provisional robbery,
		For not trampling the rye.
		.............................................
		Peasants! Yes, what's the deal
		Peasants in the world before the war.
		They only used their field to make noise,
		In order for the economy to be whole,
		Like the welfare of the country.
		The people are innocent, good-natured,
		He is disobedient to all authority,
		He knows that the city is a rogue,
		Where they drink for nothing, where they eat for nothing,
		Where is all his bread being taken?
		Destroy every threat
		He didn't give him a single nail.


An excerpt from "Walk-Pole"

		Weeping unconscious is annoying,
		Muses do not praise the voice of troubles.
		Of the coppery hulks
		The last salute is given, given,
		The one who lived is no more.

		He is no more, who walked with glory,
		For the happiness of the oppressed masses,
		Who with a proud speech, a little burr,
		Like crushing lava
		Shaking the universe to the core...

		It was a time of cruel years,
		We were nurtured by evil paws.
		In the field of peasant troubles
		Imperial satraps blossomed.
		Monarchy! An ominous stench!
		For centuries there were feast after feast,
		And sold the power to an aristocrat
		industrialists and bankers.
		The people groaned, and in this horror
		The country was waiting for someone.
		And he came.
		He is a powerful word
		He led us all to new beginnings.
		He told us: "To end the torment,
		Take everything in working hands .
		There is no more salvation for you
		Like your power and your Council."
		And we went, went to that goal
		Where did his eyes look?
		Let's go where he saw
		Liberation of all tribes...
		And so he died.
		Crying is annoying.
		Muses do not praise the voice of troubles.
		From copper barking their hulks
		The last salute is given, given,
		The one who saved us is no more.


An excerpt from a poem

		The law has not yet been approved,
		The country is noisy like bad weather.
		Whipped defiantly beyond the limit
		Freedom that poisoned us.

		Russia! Dear heart!
		The soul shrinks from pain.
		How many years does not hear the field
		Cock crow, dog barking.

		How many years has our quiet life
		Lost peaceful verbs.
		Like smallpox, pitted hooves
		Pastures and valleys are pitted.

		Silent clatter, loud groan,
		Carts and carts squeal...
		Am I sleeping and dreaming
		What's with the spears on all sides
		Are we surrounded by Pechenegs?

		Not a dream! Not a dream! I can see

		Russia! Terrible wonderful sound!
		In the trees - take it, in bloom - a snowdrop.
		Where did he roll from?
		You alarmed rebel?

		Scientific rebel, he is in a cap,
		Fed up with the spirit of foreign countries,
		With the face of the Kirghiz-Kaisak steppe
		Looks like a Russian hooligan.

		This image, freely sung,
		And say m
		So that someone does not flare up:
		Although not always, but there are portraits,
		In which he is sweet to poets.

		We love those.
		Well, in general
		Serious fame will not trample.

		Severe genius, he me
		Attracts not according to its figure,

		He did not mount a horse
		And did not fly towards the storm.

		He did not chop heads off the shoulder,
		Did not turn the infantry into escape.
		One thing in the murder he loved -
		Quail hunt.

		A hero has become conditional for us.
		We love those in black masks
		And he with snotty kids
		In winter, he rode on a sled.

		And he did not wear that hair,
		That they pour success on languid women -
		He is bald, like a tray,
		He looked more modest of the most modest.

		Shy, simple and sweet
		He is like a sphinx in front of me.
		I don't understand what power
		Did he manage to shake the globe?
		But he shook...
		... .......................................
		Noise and way
		Cool fierce, bad weather,
		Wash away from the unfortunate people
		Shame on prisons and churches.

		It was a time of cruel years,
		We were nurtured by evil paws.

		Imperial satraps blossomed.

		Monarchy! An ominous stench!
		For centuries there were feast after feast,
		And sold the power to an aristocrat
		industrialists and bankers.
		The people groaned, and in this horror
		The country was waiting for someone.
		And he came........
		...........................................
		He is a powerful word
		He led us all to new beginnings.

		He told us:
		"To end the torment,
		Take everything into working hands.
		There is no more salvation for you -
		Like your power and your Council."

		And we went under the screech of a snowstorm,
		Where did his eyes look?

		Let's go where he saw
		Liberation of all tribes...

		............................................
		.......................................... ..

		And so he died.
		Crying is annoying.
		The Muses do not praise the voice of troubles.
		Of the coppery hulks
		The last salute is given, given,
		The one who saved us
		No more.

		He is no more!
		And those who are alive
		And those he left behind
		A country in a raging flood
		Must be encased in concrete.

		Don't say to them:
		"Lenin is dead!"
		Their death did not lead to longing ...

		Even more severe and gloomy
		They do his work.


THE LEGEND ABOUT YEVPATIY KOLOVRAT, ABOUT KHAN BATU, THE COLOR OF THE THREE-HANDED ONE, ABOUT THE BLACK IDOLISH AND OUR SAVING JESUS CHRIST

		1

		With the help of Slybysh
		The clouds are circling.
		The feather grass lit up
		Underhoof tanaga.

		Oh, do not zym husk-lure
		Clogged up the regrinds, -
		The angry Tatars rose
		On the side of Zaray.

		Trubezh's lips trembled,
		Pigeon eyes fluttered
		And the hideouts are tough
		Salted salted.

		Ryazan did not wait, did not smell
		And that robber dopot,
		Under a Varangian veil
		Whilst away the dark night.

		Not an owl's ear squinted,
		And not the wolf's mouth grinned, -
		That Batu from Churilkov Hill
		While the hall of the horde at the glow.

		How the star-swallows looked,
		They made a thought-frying pan:
		Shtoy something Rus zaholynulas?
		Al does not hear the clang of abusive language?

		The stars chirped for the month:
		"Hey you, God's lamb!
		You do not crush the heavenly grass,
		Stop fighting clouds.

		Breathe coal-eyes
		Baptized into holy Rus',
		Yes, dig into cutomaria,
		What's ruffling about there?

		As the moon looked here from a leash,
		And the chewing gum has worn out its teeth,
		choked with a choke
		And coughed up blood on the ground.

		Oh, the blood is flowing with orami,
		Pasture pastures groan,
		Evil Tatars played out,
		They draw blood with poloniki.

		Ahead is the khan himself on the bulge
		Smiling on a horse
		And chews, slobbering his beard,
		A piece of dead mare.

		He says in a raspy voice:
		"Oh, bro titans ,
		Isn't it time for us to feast
		Send horses to Muscovy?

		2

		From Olga to Shviva Zavodi
		They know songs about Evpatiy.
		They are sung from the white nobility
		To the sermjazhnik.

		Although many songs are composed,
		Yes, not a word is respected
		Do not count the praise of that prowess,
		Do not discredit bold valor.

		Evpatiy's curls curled,
		In three rows they fell on the shoulders.
		Behind the glen there is a cut knife
		He propped up his white knee.

		How he kept the forge-roof,
		He forged horses and roamed,
		Yes, pawn eels
		with two fingers .

		Lots of smolt
		In the bins it is blunted.
		Only there is no pleasing zasynyka,
		Black-haired conversationa list.

		Not one beauty-darling
		Secretly wept for him
		Not one sleeve of young women
		From the aftermath he made a hole.

		Yes, not love, you see, ud alomu
		These sobs of gray bugs,
		And sweetheart to him,
		What is the Ryazan side.

		3

		How did you walk, dance
		Remove-those good fellow
		And Olga&#769; whether worried
		Foamed into steamed milk.

		Evil Tatars gathered,
		from Moscow on horseback.
		The boyars fled
		To the campsite.

		Dressed up a runaway
		They were awarded with a gray letter:
		"You run, wake up, kid,
		To judge the light of Evpaty.

		Oh, not a kolob in the field
		At the call of the sorceress from Shekhmin, -
		The rider galloped to Pilevo
		Yes, it turns back again.

		Steep white waves
		You can see them in the distance in the meadow.
		So they rush, rage
		Bite the gray cloud.

		The rider jumped to the shore,
		Pulls the reins to the quick
		Let the horse not get into confusion,
		Stretching horseshoes into two moons.

		Like a runner, he thought:
		"Ay, why does the river foam?
		There is not a chichery siver,
		Not that forest shlokh.

		4

		Yes, a good fellow got up here,
		Svet Evpaty Kolovratovich,
		I went out of the water to the sun,
		He wiped himself with burdock.

		calmed down the swell of the hlyabucha ,
		Foam clubs developed,
		And surface logs
		They bubbled like a frog.

		And the runaway will shout:
		"Oh, you lazushny bator! ..
		You run, measure your strength
		Beyond Ryazan over the Tatars.

		5

		On the burning ground
		The women are whimpering for Kolomna.
		In clamps and pads
		They took the husbands of the Tatars.

		Sweaty drovers are gushing,
		They push the polonyannikov,
		Along the pizhnu path-path
		They put milestones heads.

		At the corner of the blue sky
		Clouds are burning, logs,
		On the sukhmeni spruce-grip
		The flame-frying pan thief sees.

		Not the kitchen in the forest hesitated
		And not a skier scratches his beard,
		Walks the Savior, Savior-pleaser
		With the head down.

		God's Grid Opened
		A slanted window for a bore,
		Troeruchitsa came out
		On the porch with the mountain guard.

		And the mother of the pelega nzu made a noise:
		"Oh, my beloved son,
		You cloud the power of the enemy,
		Observe Urus condo."

		Batu was not appeased,
		Not in a dream he felt
		In reality he foresaw -
		Wild-washers are tearing the Tatars.

		Turned the horse abomination
		To a sheltered haven
		For reaping losses,
		Are the Kozelsky fortifications?

		Oh, the provytniks are boasting
		Without a break, without a reproach.
		Who were you drunk for?
		Polovtsian mistress?

		6

		At Palaga-shinkacherikha
		The wine is diluted with honey.
		Short-haired cougars
		Curtained with towels.

		Not slickers foam,
		Do not bite, commemorate -
		Comrades came together
		The light of the good Yevpaty.

		The kid is humming:
		"Oh, bosom friends,
		Isn't it time for us pumpkin heads
		Try on scimitars?

		We are not in vain, tea, for the harvest
		The sun was pierced by arrows,
		Not from idleness to the walls of paradise
		Two windows were drilled.

		Not spree kuvekali,
		Not grouse called,
		And the remote heads
		They said goodbye to the prosulyans.

		Crying zasynki for friends,
		According to Yevpaty, they are all Olgovichi.
		Young people are flying away
		In pursuit of grasshoppers.

		Oh, not bitches in you puppies
		Under the goat snags,
		Yevpaty's army flew in,
		Crushed the filthy satiation.

		Baty's heart pinched,
		Khlyabushina zakobonilos.
		Didn't the people of Ryazan get up dead
		On the brink of bloody?

		7

		And scold on paradise arable land -
		An idol argues with the Lord:
		"You give the victory to the cut,
		Orthodox Muslim."

		The Lord speaks poignantly:
		"Hey you, black idol,
		What an evil mother you are
		Titka-cherry sucked?

		Falcons fight,
		And they do not know the will of the sexes.
		How to sit their white darlings
		Whether in the tower, in the garden of paradise.

		The black idol groans,
		Eyebrows-shoots off.
		How can the evil Tatars boil -
		In resin, seething cauldrons.

		The khan rides on the white batyr,
		The saliva of cappuccia runs from the lips .
		And Yevpaty did not pull out a sword,
		The candle lit up in her hands.

		Not white birches
		Hemmed from under the gonobi,
		Friends falcons died
		Under the Tatar notches.

		Not a karachev abyss,
		Not raisins-kutya commemorative -
		The evils of the Tatars played out,
		ditch with poloniki.

		The fierce khanishche will exclaim:
		"Oh, hell, kuralesniki,
		Comfort the batyr's skull
		What about a fusel bowl.

		He doesn't drink, he doesn't drink, he messes around,
		Looks back and sniffs:
		"And all you, Russian power,
		Good for the tynovye."

Poems for occasion



* * *

		The pen is not a fairy tale
		But it has a ring.
		Serve, inkwell,
		Forest cano n.
		O eternal mother
		Holy cover.
		Love beyond the river -
		Without words.

		October 6, 1915


* * *

		Love Capital, Love Capital,
		Who I was thinking about, who I was wondering about.
		She's like a demon, she's like a lioness,
		But the face is innocent and dreadfully scarlet.

		1915


* * *

		Dear friend Misha,
		You're like a whirlwind, and I'm like a hush
		Save under a quiet roof
		About me love and memory.

		March 15, 1916


MINE

		From the shores, where blue
		Fragrant than water.
		I am the twenty-third autumn
		Came to meet here.

		I see hosts of faces
		And their laughter over wine,
		But crane cries
		I can't hear outside the window.

		Oh joyful Mina,
		I'm just like you
		In love with my valleys <?>
		Like childhood dreams.

		But heavier than a cup
		I put it to my lips
		Like a beggar with gold in a bag,
		With a tear in half.

		1917


Chastushki (About poets)

		I was sitting on the sand
		At the high bridge.
		There is no better verse
		Alexander Blok.

		Made a whistle
		From walnut.
		No funnier and louder
		Songs of Gorodetsky.

		Was restless
		Left restless.
		Soothe the verses
		Kuzmina Mihai la.

		There was a fog from Orekhovo,
		Now comes from Zuev.
		I love verses in bast shoes
		Mikolay Klyuev.

		Winds blow from the river
		They blow from the neighborhood.
		There are chintz and brocade
		At Lyubov Capital.

		Poured into the corner
		A cockroach, like a chiffchaff.
		Don't think you're growing
		That is Efimenochka.

		Ah, rash, ah, fry,
		Mayakovsky is a mediocrity.
		Erysipelas are fed with paint,
		Rob Whitman.

		Bryusov is dancing along Tverskaya
		Not a mouse, but a rat.
		Uncles, uncles, I'm big
		I'll be bald soon.

		Ah, fathers, oh-oh-oh,
		There is a poet Mariengof.
		I ate a lot, drank a lot,
		Went without underpants.

		Dry kvass, amber kvass,
		The barrel is old and new.
		At Vasyatka at Kamensky
		Oak head.

		1917-1919


* * *

		Not poems golden foam
		And not Stenkin's rumor, -
		Ponikovskaya Elena
		Thinly knits kruzheva.
		The forest is wrapped in them
		I'm confused.

		1918


ACROSTIC

		Joy, like a fast roach,
		Yurko shines even in the water.
		Hands can build a church
		And the cuckoo and the star.
		Kaysya cornfields and bird cherry -
		The living have no sins.
		Out of luck swell slip
		In the oyut only for cows.
		Don't call yourself a robber
		If you are clean, then fall into the dirt.
		Believe - a calf from a pail
		Smiling crucian.

		Morning, January 21, 1919


HOW SHOULD A MARINA BE RECOMMENDED

		I'll tell you it's not flat,
		In it, all the words are important:
		Marino and Ivanovskaya
		You must call me.

		Frame me easily
		I am a small portrait.
		Now I'm learning to read
		And soon I'm six years old.

		My eyes are brown
		And the cheeks are not bad.
		Ah, sometimes I'm on a roll
		I can read poetry.

		My pen is not famous
		Sometimes I write out of tune
		But most like
		I should eat shykolat.

		Dear Peraskeva,
		After all, you are not Eve!
		Throw things away
		Love Costa.
		Friendship to you gentle autumn,
		I remain - Sergei Yesenin.

		PS
		We drink everything.
		I shake your hand.

		1924


* * *

		Oh my life
		Girl's smile.
		We drink to Goldsmith
		And for Galkevich.

		The glass will be empty
		Like life is empty.
		Hold on Muran
		Your glass to your lips.

		Aunt Motya
		In a pink hood ,
		Uncle Vadya
		In festive attire
		Cousin Zina
		In a rubber raincoat
		Dad
		In pajamas,
		On mom
		Hat,
		On my son Mishka
		New pants -
		Do the walk
		Along our alley...
		And suddenly a phenomenon
		To everyone's surprise:
		Flushed with heat
		Young painters -
		Tit and Vasya
		The house is being painted.
		Carve up the walls
		Under pink...
		Mishka screams:
		- See how!
		This is clever -
		Instead of a brush, a syringe! -
		And Papa Misha:
		- Surprise be quiet!
		Is it hard to guess
		What is mechanization ?
		Soon they'll even learn
		Douche portraits and landscapes!

		1924


* * *

		I will never forget the night
		Your squint, my top hat and sofa.
		And how you puffed calf's eyes
		Everyone knows Vanka and Ivan.

		Never be sad about life
		She has a lot of clumsy paws,
		And please forgive me
		For night stray drunken snoring.

		March 19, 1925

		Let me sometimes get wet from alcohol,
		Let the heart weaken, eyes grow dim,
		But, Gurvich! looking at this picture,
		Do you remember me and "Baku worker ".

		I don't know if it's my holiday or their worst day,
		We often bark each other like bitches,
		But if Frishberg gave everyone money,
		Then the newspaper would be heaven for us.

		The best minutes
		Were with dear Anyuta.
		Her eyes are like blue doors,
		My love is in them
		They also have a heart.

On the book "Birch chintz". M.: State. publishing house, 1925:

		I won't soak my heart in wine.
		Dear Evdokimoch,
		While I'm quiet
		This book and verse.

		Dear Vova,
		Great.
		I don't have a bad
		"Live"
		But if you're not married
		Don't marry.
		July 26, 1925


* * *

		I drank vodka, I drank whiskey,
		It's just a pity without you, Bystritsky.

		We don't need hells, heavens,
		If only Valya Kataev would live.

		Because we are close to Sasha,
		That his fate is like ours.
