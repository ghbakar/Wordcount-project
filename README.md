Word Counter implementation
========================

## Task

You have been supplied with a book in `txt` format called `polnoe-esenin.txt`. You goal is to write a script that counts how many times each word occurs and then output the result to screen in key-value pairs (JSON).

**Example**

```json
{"the" : 56,
"banana" : 16,
"example" : 4,
"minions" : 75}
```

## Notes

 - The book is in Russian Cyrillic, intentionally, to see how you'll handle UTF-8 (*Also, Esenin was a great poet*).
